“political revolution” has lit a prairie fire  Hillary Rodham Clinton’s insistence at Tuesday night’s debate that she  too  is a progressive but one who “likes to get things done ” brought her new respect and support Mrs  Clinton’s self assurance  command of issues and ease in parrying Mr  Sanders at the forum in Las Vegas drew praise from Iowa Democrats  who will cast the first nominating votes on Feb  1 Iowans have observed the two leading candidates closely  Mrs  Clinton has spent 22 days campaigning in the state  and Mr  Sanders 20  The former secretary of state holds a narrow lead in most Iowa polls  but Mr  Sanders  a Vermont senator  has cut deeply into the aura of inevitability that surrounded her in the spring “Like a lot of people in Iowa  I was on the fence between Sanders and Clinton ” said Jaime Bernal  who works in accounting for Wells Fargo in Des Moines  “I just needed that little push ”He came away from the debate doubting Mr  Sanders’s ability to work with Republicans in Congress and was encouraged that Mrs  Clinton has the political skills to build bridges  “She’s shown her leadership ” he said A third candidate  Martin O’Malley  a former Maryland governor  was also cited as impressive in interviews with more than a dozen debate watchers who had not previously committed to a candidate “I think we’ll see O’Malley rise in the polls ” said Representative John Forbes  whose state House district is in suburban Des Moines “He just had an issue of breaking out “ he said  “Now the American public has seen him  has seen what type of quality individual he is  He’d do very well serving as our next president ”Mr  Forbes  a pharmacist  attended a debate watch party at a Mexican restaurant in Urbandale  where the shuttered former headquarters of Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin  who quit the Republican race  was a few doors down  Before the debate  he said the big issue for Mrs  Clinton was “character and trust” because of her use of a private email system as secretary of state Mr  Forbes said he did not think she laid the questions to rest  But he was in a minority  Most debate watchers said the highlight of the night was Mr  Sanders’s saying “the American people are sick and tired” of the issue of Mrs  Clinton’s “damn emails ”Mrs  Clinton satisfied questions about trustworthiness when she noted that President Obama had trusted her enough to pick her to run the State Department  said Becky Schmitz  a social worker in Jefferson County  Before the debate  she leaned toward Mrs  Clinton but had doubts  Afterward  the doubts were gone  “She strengthened my position towards her ” Ms  Schmitz said  “She was very poised and strong  and I thought she carried the debate ”That was a sentiment shared even by Democrats who did not come away supporting Mrs  Clinton “I’d love to be a Hillary girl because I’d love to see a female president ” said Peggy Sherrets  the mayor of Oelwein  population 6 400  in northeast Iowa  “I’m just not sure she’s electable  I’m wondering if her time hasn’t passed ”Ms  Sherrets  too  seemed impressed with Mr  O’Malley  especially his statement that he had infuriated the National Rifle Association with gun control measures he passed as governor  “I grew up with guns and believe in the Second Amendment  but it’s gotten out of hand ” she said  “It’s gotten very scary  even in small towns ”Mrs  Clinton’s strong performance caused supporters of Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  to worry he has hesitated too long to enter the race  “I’ve kind of given up hope ” said Dean Lane  a farmer in Newton  who believes Mr  Biden would have an easier time winning a general election than Mrs  Clinton  who will continue to ignite Republican fury  “He would have had an easier time if he’d gotten in a month ago ”Mary Bruner  who runs human resources for her family owned bank in Carroll  approached the debate as if it were a job interview “I love Bernie’s passion and I love almost all of his positions ” she said  But she thought Mrs  Clinton offered the more “stellar résumé” and showed she had “people skills” needed for the presidency  “What was impressive was when another candidate was talking  she listened to them ” she said  “I thought she was genuine  I thought she was prepared ”Some voters who were unexpectedly impressed with Mr  O’Malley said he would be a better second choice candidate if somehow Mrs  Clinton stumbles  “Before  he had seemed milquetoast to me ” said Cal Tormey  a writer who works as a waiter in Des Moines  “I was impressed by how strong he came across ” But he still plans to caucus for Mrs  Clinton  whom he supported in 2008  “I’m trying to bet on the horse that I think will win ” he said Ben Nesselhuf  the vice president for development at an addiction treatment program in Sioux City  said he was still undecided after watching the debate “For Hillary Clinton  the bar was set high  and she went over it by a lot ” he said  “She’s had a rough six months with the Republicans zeroing in on her  and that’s taken a toll  I thought she was great last night ”A former chairman of South Dakota’s Democratic Party who moved to Iowa recently  Mr  Nesselhuf said that Mr  Sanders did “a good job introducing himself and his philosophy to a wider audience ” and that Mr  O’Malley “proved he belonged” in the race  As for the two other candidates on the stage  Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee  Mr  Nesselhuf said they were out of their league and “don’t belong on the stage ”Sarah and Bryan Vanderpool  professional folks singers who recently moved from Los Angeles  began the debate as Sanders supporters  Mr  Vanderpool was still one afterward  “He really spoke to the issues and I’m really excited about him ” he said But Ms  Vanderpool found herself unexpectedly drawn to the gravitational field of Mrs  Clinton  “I came in really  really supporting Bernie  and now I like them both ” she said  “She really handled herself well  she has a history of working on the stuff she’s going to be dealing with if she’s president ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Wins Iowa Fans With Debate Performance","print_headline":"Clinton Wins Iowa

For me  it was his rally on Monday in Dallas  where he told an adoring crowd he was disgusted with what was happening to America  He called it “a dumping ground for the rest of the world ”The garbage he was referring to is people  the same kind of people we describe more poetically on a plaque at the foot of the Statue of Liberty Mr  Trump’s rivals are talking  in all seriousness  of undoing the Constitution and building a border wall  A Fox News host compares immigration to “a tumor or a disease ” Two young thugs in Boston attack and urinate on a homeless Latino man  saying Mr  Trump inspired them  A Trump supporter outside the Dallas rally grabs a microphone and yells at anti Trump protesters  “Clean my hotel room  bitch ” Another  referring to Mr  Trump’s mass deportation plan  says  “This isn’t going to be painless  They’ve been inflicting pain on us for 20 years ”It’s not clear that Mr  Trump will end up with any power to pursue his racist agenda — his ambitions seem a lot narrower  more TV based  But the toxic support he is stirring up  the polluted ideas he is spreading  the hate he is emboldening his supporters to voice with his blaring  surround sound campaign — that evil will live after him  We will be cleaning up after Mr  Trump for a long time Vice President Joe Biden spoke reassuringly to a Latino group on Tuesday  saying that Mr  Trump and his fellow Republicans were taking pages from an old playbook that always fails “This will pass ” he said  This “sick message” has been tried on America before  and we always — “always  always  always  always” — overcome it Yes  we do  but it keeps coming back  and keeps doing damage I think of some recent examples  close to home Long Island  where I live  has been transformed in recent years  like many other American suburbs  by an influx of Latino immigrants  The demographics of Long Island’s two counties  Nassau and Suffolk  are similar  But where Nassau had a cool  pragmatic county executive  who talked of unity and sensible solutions  Suffolk had a county executive who liked to blame immigrants for overburdened housing  schools and hospitals  and for supposedly lawless acts like gathering on sidewalks to look for work  His words inflamed and incited community passions  his claims that immigrants were a blight on the county found a receptive audience And Suffolk  not Nassau  became nationally notorious for repeated attacks on Latino immigrants  including one horrific murder  Even the county police department was accused of patterns of racial abuse  Other politicians have risen to power in communities where people feel uneasy and resentful and are looking for a target for their anger  Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County  Ariz   has perennially been elected despite — or rather because of — his history of oppressing Latinos in his jurisdiction Mr  Trump has made the nativists restless  on a national scale  Those in media and entertainment who are distracted by his comedic potential are missing the point  Jimmy Fallon  doing a skit with Mr  Trump  normalizes his toxic message  with giggles   I’m hoping that Stephen Colbert  who has Mr  Trump on his show next week  will do better at avoiding this moral trap  but I’m not holding my breath  The Trump effect leads to a question I’ve been pondering  Is politics like physics  where adding gas to a container creates pressure and heat?

near recluse when friends urged her to take a chance and appear at the Academy Awards last year Sitting at home  Donald J  Trump spotted Ms  Novak  then 81  on his television screen and recoiled at her appearance  He tapped out a message on Twitter “I’m having a real hard time watching ” Mr  Trump wrote  “Kim should sue her plastic surgeon ”To Ms  Novak  who read the message after the show  it was a devastating setback in her return to public life  She retreated to Oregon  fell into what she called “a tailspin” and refused to leave her house for days  In an open letter to her fans a few weeks later  Ms  Novak denounced Mr  Trump’s tweet as bullying For Mr  Trump  a serial exploiter of old line media  it was a painful yet potent lesson in the power of new media to agitate and motivate a vast  unseen audience  Inundated with replies of disgust and support  he eventually backtracked online  “I was always a big fan of Kim Novak”  and sent her a rueful private letter A year later  Mr  Trump has mastered Twitter in a way no candidate for president ever has  unleashing and redefining its power as a tool of political promotion  distraction  score settling and attack — and turning a 140 character task that other candidates farm out to young staff members into a centerpiece of his campaign In the process  he has managed to fulfill a vision  long predicted but slow to materialize  sketched out a decade ago by a handful of digital campaign strategists  a White House candidacy that forgoes costly  conventional methods of political communication and relies instead on the free  urgent and visceral platforms of social media “He’s used social media to replace the traditional apparatus of a political campaign ” said Zac Moffatt  who oversaw Mitt Romney’s digital outreach in 2012 and co founded Targeted Victory  a consulting firm focused on online campaign tactics  “Trump is living on this medium ”Now  as Mr  Trump enters an uncertain period in his campaign  even rival campaigns acknowledge that Twitter is providing a powerful bulwark against a slide in his poll numbers  by allowing millions of supporters to make his case for him and deflect the controversies he delights in touching off His online dominance is striking  Over the past two months  on Twitter alone  he has been mentioned in 6 3 million conversations  eight times as many as Republican rivals like Marco Rubio  Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson — not to mention more than three times as many as Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly four times as many as Bernie Sanders  He is retweeted more than twice as often as Mrs  Clinton and about 13 times more frequently than Jeb Bush  according to data compiled as of Friday by Edelman Berland  a market research firm that studies social media  His Twitter following  4 36 million  dwarfs that of the rest of the Republican field  and in the coming weeks  he is expected to surpass Mrs  Clinton  4 39 million  In an interview at his office — interrupted repeatedly by Mr  Trump’s picking up his Samsung Galaxy cellphone  loading new tweets with his index finger and marveling at his nonstop mentions  “Watch this ” he implored  — the candidate compared his Twitter feed to a newspaper with a single  glorious voice  his own “The Ernest Hemingway of a hundred and forty characters ” he said  quoting a fan In the past  Mr  Trump said  when dealing with a dishonest rival “there was nothing you can do other than sue ”“Which I’ve done ” he added  “But it’s a long process ”Now  he simply tweets  Caustically  colorfully and repeatedly Suddenly  he said of his foes  “I have more power than they do ”“I can let people know that they were a fraud ” he continued  “I can let people know that they have no talent  that they didn’t know what they’re doing  You have a voice ”On Twitter  Mr  Trump has assembled an online SWAT team of devoted  some say rabid  supporters who spring into action with stunning speed  In a pattern that has played out over and over  he makes a provocative remark  like one about Mrs  Fiorina’s face — “Would anybody vote for that?’’ — and hundreds of thousands of strangers defend him  spread his message and engage in emotional debates with his critics  all the while ensuring he remains the subject of a constant conversation When Mr  Trump wanted to defend his failure to correct a white voter who declared that Barack Obama is a Muslim  he tapped out a message on Sept  19 It was quickly retweeted by 7 000 people  and over roughly six hours it provoked more than 1 000 discussions that mentioned him  Forty percent of those were pro Trump in sentiment  according to Edelman Berland The next day  Mr  Bush fired off an unusually pointed tweet  by his standards  attacking a campaign ad about Sept  11 that was made by allies of Mrs  Clinton  But its life cycle was comparatively short and tepid  It received only about one twelfth as many retweets  and provoked around 200 conversations over about an hour  of which 5 percent were pro Bush  the firm found Mike Berland  a political operative who worked on Mrs  Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign and is chief executive of Edelman Berland  calls it the “Wall of Trump ”“We’ve never seen this before in politics ” Mr  Berland said  “This is not just a rally that happens once in a while  This is a continuous Trump rally that happens on Twitter at all hours  He fills the Twitter stadium every day ”Many mornings around 3 30  Eric Popkin  a 53 year old project manager at an architecture firm with no ties to the campaign  logs on to his computer in Orlando  Fla   and creates elaborate graphics in support of Mr  Trump that he disseminates on Twitter Mr  Trump’s candor and style inspire a loyalty he cannot quite explain  “It’s like a sports team  If you are from New York  and you like the Jets or Giants and somebody is bad mouthing your team  there is kind of knee jerk reaction to defend them ” Mr  Popkin said  “We have an emotional connection to him  It’s good old human nature ”Not all of the outpouring is spontaneous  Supporters have organized themselves into online squads that defend Mr  Trump  A man identifying himself as Gary Forbes has recruited volunteer “operatives” on Twitter  sending out daily emails directing them to emphasize pro Trump messages  “Trump’s immigration plan will protect thousands of women from abuse”  and target rival candidates  “What Jeb must do for Fox Billionaire Murdoch’s    ”   A project code named “Magic Kingdom” took aim last week at Mr  Rubio  the senator from Florida  according to an email obtained by The New York Times Asked about the effort  Mr  Forbes directed questions to the Trump campaign  A Trump spokeswoman  Hope Hicks  said the campaign had no affiliation with Mr  Forbes Mr  Trump  69  is an improbable virtuoso of the tweet  He has no computer in his office  a staff member brings in a laptop to show him videos  and asks aides to print his emails for consumption the old fashioned way  But around 2011  his staff turned him on to the possibilities of @realdonaldtrump  a sleepy account started in 2009 that largely quoted from Mr  Trump’s books He quickly adapted to Twitter’s stock in trade  endless feuds  ego stroking and casual cruelty  He usually dictates messages to his assistant during the day and types them himself at home or on the golf course  from which he has sent more than 100  according to geographic data embedded in his tweets  The most frequently used words in his tweets  “great”  more than 700 times   “winner” or “winners”  43   and “loser” or “losers”  34   In all  he has sent more than 28 000 tweets — the rough equivalent of 12 a day Mr  Trump has called Arianna Huffington  the liberal website publisher  “unattractive both inside and out”  described Bette Midler as “extremely unattractive”  and declared that President Obama had guaranteed “you won’t see another black president for generations ”Asked about his judgment in sending those messages  he defended all but one  his mockery of Ms  Novak  “I would have preferred I didn’t send it ” Mr  Trump said  “That was done in fun  but sometimes you do things in fun and they turn out to be hurtful  and I don’t like doing that ”He has developed strong views about the rules  rituals and rhythms of Twitter  On the 140 character limit  “I wish it were longer on 10 percent of the occasions ”On deleting tweets  “One of the things I do find is that when you delete it  it becomes a bigger story than having it ”That  of course  has not stopped him from deleting tweets  like a 2013 message in which he extended “best wishes to all  even the haters and losers  on this special date  September 11th ”His followers on Twitter did not seem to mind  Back in his office at Trump Tower the other day  he kept collecting new mentions  even though he had not sent a tweet in hours “Look at this ” Mr  Trump beckoned  “So this is eight seconds ago  See that?” Messages scrolled by in a blur  “That’s eight seconds ago these tweets came in ”He looked up with satisfaction  “How ” he asked  “can you do better than that?”","headline":{"main":"Pithy, Mean and Powerful: How Donald Trump Mastered Twitter

to halt the momentum of her insurgent challenger  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  aggressively questioned his values  positions and voting history Tuesday night in the first Democratic presidential debate  turning a showdown that had been expected to scrutinize her character into a forceful critique of his record In a series of sometimes biting exchanges  Mrs  Clinton declared that Mr  Sanders was mistaken in his handling of crucial votes on gun control and misguided in his grasp of the essentialness of capitalism to the American identity  Mocking Mr  Sanders’s admiration for the health care system of Denmark  she interrupted a moderator to offer a stinging assessment of his logic  suggesting he was unprepared to grapple with the realities of governing a superpower “We are not Denmark ” Mrs  Clinton said  adding with a sly smile  “I love Denmark  We are the United States of America ”The crowd erupted in applause A few moments later  Mrs  Clinton took aim at what may be Mr  Sanders’s greatest vulnerability with the Democratic left  asking why he had voted to shield gun makers and dealers from liability lawsuits  Mr  Sanders  who linked his record on gun control to his representation of a rural state  called the bill “large and complicated ”“I was in the Senate at the same time ” Mrs  Clinton replied  “It wasn’t that complicated to me  It was pretty straightforward ”Asked if Mr  Sanders had been tough enough on guns during his decades long career in Congress  Mrs  Clinton offered a sharp reply  “No  Not at all ”“I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence ” she said  “This has gone on too long  and it’s time the entire country stood up against the N R A ”It was a dominant performance that showcased Mrs  Clinton’s political arsenal  a long record of appearances in presidential debates  intense and diligent preparation  and a nimbleness and humor largely lacking in her male counterparts  She let no opportunity pass her by  When Mr  Sanders described the conflict in Syria as “a quagmire within a quagmire” but said he did not support sending American ground troops there  Mrs  Clinton interjected energetically  “Nobody does  Nobody does  Senator Sanders ”For Mr  Sanders  the gathering in Las Vegas provided an evening of unexpectedly forceful challenges  both from Mrs  Clinton and from the moderator  Anderson Cooper of CNN  At times  he seemed somewhat exasperated and unsure about how to match Mrs  Clinton’s agility  Perhaps his most memorable moment occurred when he zestfully defended Mrs  Clinton from criticism of her email practices “Let me say something that may not be great politics ” he said  “But I think the secretary is right  and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails ”Mrs  Clinton flashed a wide smile and shook her rival’s hand  “Thank you  Bernie ” she said  setting off huge applause in the auditorium Mr  Sanders regained his footing when the debate turned to one of his signature issues  Wall Street and its excesses Mrs  Clinton said that her plan to crack down on wrongdoers on Wall Street “would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail ” but that Mr  Sanders’s proposal to break up banks was naïve  Mr  Sanders grew animated “Congress does not regulate Wall Street ” he said  setting off roars from the crowd  “Wall Street regulates Congress ”He suggested that the real naïveté was Mrs  Clinton’s notion that reaching out to Wall Street was part of the solution  “ ‘Please do the right thing ’ ” he said  “is kind of naïve ”And there were reminders of the tendencies that have made the left wing of the Democratic party suspicious of Mrs  Clinton  Prodded about her history of changing positions on major issues  she inelegantly explained why it took her so long to come out against the proposed Canadian American oil pipeline that so many of her rivals already oppose  “I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone ”Mrs  Clinton benefited for much of the night from the tentativeness of her rivals  who appeared wary of directly attacking the figure who represents their party’s best chance at electing a woman president  Instead  they offered oblique criticisms and diplomatic dismissals  In his opening statement  Lincoln Chafee  the former senator and governor of Rhode Island  told the audience  “What I’m most proud of is that  in 30 years of public service  I have had no scandals  I have high ethical standards ”Jim Webb  the former senator from Virginia  seemed to take a swipe at Mrs  Clinton’s decades in public life and her closeness to Democratic Party insiders  saying the country was looking for somebody “who understands how the system works  who has not been co opted by it ”There were exceptions  of course  Former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  when asked whether Mrs  Clinton would be too quick to use American military force  scolded her for her 2002 Senate vote to authorize military action in Iraq  saying the vote had been carried out “under false pretenses” and calling the war “one of the worst blunders in modern American history ”Mr  O’Malley  who has struggled to match Mrs  Clinton’s organizational might and Mr  Sanders’s message  repeatedly found ways to stand out  making a case for expanding the Affordable Care Act to cover the children of undocumented immigrants “We are a nation of immigrants ” he said  “I am for a generous  compassionate America that says we are all in this together ”As the debate went on  Mr  O’Malley  the youngest of the five candidates at 52  said he had heard from Americans of all stripes that they hungered for new  post Clinton leadership “I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country  but our country needs new leadership to move forward ” he said For Mrs  Clinton  the forum was a highly anticipated return to the debate stage after a seven year hiatus and a season of remarkable political convulsions  the revelation that she relied exclusively on a private email server as secretary of state  the emergence of Mr  Sanders  a once obscure senator from Vermont  as a potent rival in Iowa and New Hampshire  the threat of Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr ’s entering the race  and the restless liberal tide within the Democratic electorate that she is struggling to command Her assertiveness was striking  given that on the campaign trail  she has seemed unsure of how to neutralize Mr  Sanders’s crowd luring popularity  Her campaign has feared that attacking a candidate beloved by supporters for his quirky style  raw frustration and unvarnished liberalism could alienate precisely the segment of the Democratic electorate she would need to win the general election She seemed highly attuned to what may be her biggest vulnerabilities in 2016  her authenticity and questions about whether she cares about the problems of ordinary people  In a CBS News poll released Sunday  61 percent of registered voters said they did not trust her  and 48 percent said she did not care about people like them In Las Vegas  she smiled and laughed regularly  After a commercial  she joked about the duration of her allotted bathroom break  “You know  it does take me a little longer ” she said  referring to the men around her The debate captured what has emerged as a consensus in the Democratic Party  that urgent action is needed to address the subject of income inequality  Mr  Sanders assailed the power of the nation’s wealthiest and called for Americans to “take back our government from a handful of billionaires ”But in an incongruous touch  the debate was held at the Wynn hotel  a slender golden curve of Las Vegas excess  conceived by the billionaire Steve Wynn  In a strange tableau for a political party preoccupied with the gap between rich and poor  a mix of around 1 300 prominent officials and wealthy donors filed into a ballroom down the hall from rows of luxury fashion stores and poker tables   Before the debate started  one Clinton donor bragged of winning  25 000 at the tables  The debate  hosted by CNN  was billed as a prizefight with a network of promotion showing silhouettes of Mr  Sanders and Mrs  Clinton on giant screens overlooking the city’s famed Strip  But it was thick with foreign and domestic policy concerns  rather than the personal insults and colorful exchanges that have characterized the Republican forums Yet there were lighter moments  Toward the close of the evening  Mr  Cooper asked the candidates whom they were most proud to call an enemy  The contenders ticked off a list of predictable villains to the left  the coal industry  the National Rifle Association  drug companies and health insurers Mrs  Clinton added mischievously  “Iranians  probably the Republicans ”But it was Mr  Webb  a former marine who fought in Vietnam  who offered an unforgettable answer “I’d have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me  but he’s not around right now to talk to ” he said ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Turns Up Heat on Bernie Sanders in a

does not inspire neutral opinions  He is a savior or a disaster  a bigot or a patriot  a truth teller or a buffoon  a commanding front runner or a bubble on the verge of bursting  On one point  at least  there is something like political pundit consensus  that Mr  Trump’s abrasive  celebrity driven  Don Ricklesian candidacy is unprecedented And it is unprecedented  if your television watching is limited to C Span and CNN  But if you’ve watched reality TV over the past decade or two  you’ve seen it plenty  You’ve seen it in Richard Hatch and Russell Hantz  the love to hate them manipulators of “Survivor”  in the backbiting contestants in the boardroom of Mr  Trump’s “The Apprentice”  in Courtney Robertson  the feisty winner of “The Bachelor” who captured her experience in the book “I Didn’t Come Here to Make Friends ” which would make a great title for Mr  Trump’s eventual campaign memoir It would be reductive — and dismissive of the conservative and populist forces behind Mr  Trump’s rise — to say that his campaign simply means that politics has become reality TV  But Mr  Trump’s style does suggest that he learned at least as much about campaigning in the boardroom of “The Apprentice” as in any actual boardroom Traditional presidential politics is like television in Ed Sullivan’s day  when the big three networks developed the idea of “least objectionable programming” — broad  inoffensive  something for everyone shows intended to keep anyone from changing the channel Reality TV  like Mr  Trump’s campaign  is a product of a fractious time of niche audiences  When there are hundreds of entertainment outlets  “least objectionable” is death  You need to stand out And he does  Like reality TV itself  Mr  Trump is a love or hate proposition  In a general election  true  you need much more than 23 percent of the vote  which is Mr  Trump’s number in a recent USA Today Suffolk University poll of the Republican field   But in today’s television  a 23 share is a landslide — and in a crowded primary in an ideologically fragmented party  it is large enough for first place Understanding these dynamics has let Mr  Trump reverse the polarity of primary campaigning  Where traditional candidates have gaffes  he has publicity opportunities  Even his ugliest remarks — saying  after a rough debate on Fox News  that the moderator Megyn Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever” — seemed  among his followers  to burnish his reputation as a straight shooter  It’s “The Real World” approach to politics  Let me show you  America  what happens when candidates stop being polite and start getting real It’s paradoxical that Mr  Trump should be the one to bring primary politics further into the niche media era  After all  he was a boldface name when Ronald Reagan was president  and there was a time  in the 1990s and the early 2000s  when he seemed like a holdover from the Gordon Gekko ’80s  a nostalgia piece  a Rubik’s Cube  a shoulder pad “The Apprentice” revived him as a celebrity  which  business success aside  is the entire point of Donald Trump  The key to Mr  Trump’s appeal as host of the show was the key to his appeal before and since  his attention to surface appearances Others have questioned whether Mr  Trump is actually as rich or successful as he says   Like the debate over whether reality TV is “real ” it’s a concern for detractors but brushed off by the fan base   But for television purposes  he looked the part  and he did it by happily creating the most vivid pop culture cartoon of wealth outside a Monopoly box From his “Art of the Deal” tabloid era heyday to today  Mr  Trump has been a rich guy who lives like a lottery winner  His business was in casinos and hotels and golf courses  concrete things you could see and understand  as opposed to Mitt Romney’s chilly abstractions of private equity  Not for him the modesty of hoodie wearing Silicon Valley  He wore suits and married models and built a 64 story tower in Las Vegas sheathed in 24 karat gold He presented an idea of wealth that was brazen and crass and thus to his admirers rang open and honest  whatever legerdemain went into the actual business  This made Mr  Trump a great fit for reality TV  which treats the currency of fame the way he treats the currency of  well  currency  That is  you grow it by flaunting it   The gilded aesthetic of his properties is more or less that of your typical dating show mansion   Likewise on the campaign trail  he didn’t poor mouth himself or claim to be just like you  He flew on his helicopter to the Iowa State Fair  like the fictional President Charles Lindbergh flying his jet over the Potomac in Philip Roth’s “The Plot Against America ”His pugilism can be petty and indiscriminate  he began the second Republican debate by saying unprompted that Rand Paul  scarcely a threat to him  “shouldn’t even be on this stage ” But that’s reality TV combat  You fight to prove you’re a fighter  Mr  Trump knows that it is better to be the instigator than the instigated upon  It allows you to set the rhythm  change the subject  get in people’s heads  determine the narrative After all  can you name a single noncelebrity contestant from “The Apprentice”? If so  it’s probably Omarosa  who didn’t win the show’s first season but  because of her clashes with fellow contestants and Mr  Trump  was its breakout star   She also was a model for the appalling history of reality shows painting black women as belligerent villains  and she later claimed to be the victim of editing  But she was a star nonetheless  Mr  Trump seems to have learned from his apprentices  Facing elimination by him in the boardroom on “The Apprentice” was like being trapped in a cage with a capricious monster  you didn’t know what might anger him or why  but it was your job to make sure he ate your opponent instead of you  The situation rewarded fast talking and improvisation  And Mr  Trump’s campaign style is nothing if not improvisatory — tactical eruptions to throw rivals off balance  to dismiss tough questions  to promise easy answers without details  to survive until the next episode He’s lived and campaigned by reality show creeds  There’s no such thing as bad attention  apologies are weakness  whining is for haters and losers  And winning  Mr  Trump’s favorite gerund  like Charlie Sheen’s  is its own justification  Like the winners on “Survivor” who eventually get praised for backstabbing their way to victory — they were just playing the game  — Mr  Trump has thus far been able to make his poll numbers the rationale for his tactics Of course  if his numbers start heading dramatically down  that same dynamic could set up a self sustaining negative feedback loop  a narrative that justifies his downfall  what they call in the reality TV business “the loser edit ”If Mr  Trump does end up fading  as some analysts are beginning to predict  you could look at “The Apprentice” for a parallel  It was  as its host would say  huge in 2004  its first finale had over 28 million viewers  Then it declined  You could blame overscheduling  poor lead ins  a 2005 spinoff starring Martha Stewart  But it also had a gimmick  Mr  Trump himself  that lost its novelty  In reality TV  successful formats  “Survivor ” “Dancing With the Stars”  can last a long time  but individual personalities — Paris Hilton  Simon Cowell — wear thin  Mr  Trump was not just the host but the game  and the game got old But if you’re looking at “The Apprentice” for signs of the future of the celebrity political complex  it’s also worth noting that the show never went away  It’s lasted 14 seasons  having switched over to a modestly rated “Celebrity Apprentice” format  And though NBC cut Mr  Trump from the show after his campaign controversies  it will return next year with another entertainer turned politician  turned entertainer again   Arnold Schwarzenegger The star may come and go  The show will go on ","headline":{"main":"What ‘The Apprentice’ Taught Donald Trump About Campaigning","content_kicker":"Critic's Notebook","print_headline":"Trump’s Campaign Classroom: Reality TV"},"wordCount":"1338"},

an impenetrable wall along the border with Mexico nor because I’ve been following his grotesque campaign with the kind of guilty gusto that got me hooked on the reality show “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo ”I’m rooting for Donald Trump because he could unlock the potential of America’s Latino electorate Hispanics  among the fastest growing of all segments of eligible voters  played a crucial role in President Obama’s two elections  Yet  over the past couple of decades  pollsters and political operatives have regarded the Latino vote as a sleeping giant waiting for the right jolt Hispanics have understandably responded to the xenophobic Trump campaign — which has hardened the immigration positions of other Republican candidates — with outrage  But many political organizers see him as a godsend “Quite frankly  it’s the best thing that can happen to us as community leaders to convince people that not participating in civic life has consequences ” said Ben Monterroso  the executive director of Mi Familia Vota Education Fund  one of several organizations that are mounting an ambitious effort to get Latinos to vote in 2016  “They’re challenging the Latino community to see if we’re going to be able to defend ourselves at the ballot box ”In 2012  48 percent of eligible Latino voters cast ballots in the presidential election  lagging behind white and African American voters  whose turnout rates were 64 percent and 67 percent  respectively  Eligible voters of Mexican origin had an even lower turnout  42 percent An estimated 5 4 million Latinos are eligible to become American citizens but have yet to take that step  making them by far the largest pool of non naturalized immigrants who could become eligible to vote by 2016  Among them  Mexicans have been the least likely to naturalize  The cost of the process  roughly  680  and anxiety about taking a civics test are among the reasons many Latinos have not become citizens In 2016  an estimated 26 7 million Latinos will be eligible to vote  58 percent more than a decade ago Mr  Trump has promised to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants  seize the remittances Mexican immigrants send to relatives back home and charge the Mexican government for the wall he intends to build  His vision  which  unmistakably  is to “Make America White Again ” has triggered outrage in Latinos of diverse backgrounds  nationalities  political outlooks and immigration statuses His campaign antagonized Univision  the dominant Spanish language news network  and put its top anchor  Jorge Ramos  on a warpath  The Cuban American singer Pitbull delivered an impassioned speech denouncing Mr  Trump  The Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin wrote an op ed article saying Trump’s candidacy “makes my blood boil ” The Colombian star Shakira called the boorish candidate “hateful and racist ” The Latin music moguls Emilio and Gloria Estefan are enlisting other artists to record a track titled “We’re All Mexican” to convey how much the candidacy has inflamed the community “When you’re attacked  belittled  characterized as being unworthy and subhuman  it has an effect of unifying and leading to collective action ” said Cristóbal Alex  president of the Latino Victory Project  one of the leading national groups seeking to increase Latino political clout  “It has folks angry  and our job is to take that anger and turn it into action ”What is unfolding nationally is reminiscent of the 1994 initiative championed by Pete Wilson  a Republican who was then governor of California  that sought to bar undocumented immigrants from attending public schools and seeking medical care The measure  which passed but was never carried out  drove Latino immigrants to become naturalized in droves and register to vote  Largely as a result  California became a solidly Democratic state  where running on an anti immigrant platform is today broadly regarded as political suicide Seeking to replicate that model in battleground states and those that could ultimately flip from red to blue  several well financed liberal groups are working to register voters and persuade permanent residents to become citizens in Florida  Nevada  Colorado  Texas and Arizona  The Dallas chapter of Catholic Charities is on track to assist with 840 citizenship applications this year  a twofold increase from five years ago  when the effort began “People are up in arms ” said Vanna Slaughter  the head of that chapter’s immigration unit  referring to anti immigrant messages that the current crop of Republican candidates has amplified Latinos are far from monolithic in their views and politics  There are plenty of libertarians and social conservatives who are drawn to Republican principles and policies  Some want even more restrictive immigration policies But the vast majority of us feel strongly that America desperately needs immigration reform that offers unauthorized immigrants a path to citizenship  The current Republican candidates are making a fundamental mistake by making Latinos feel unwelcome at home “Donald Trump can disappear tomorrow ” Mr  Monterroso said  “But the damage is done

Why? Not a single detail  But Trump doesn’t do details  He just crows that he will know the most  be the best and win  He’s a broken record of grandiose  self infatuated music The most satisfying  encouraging moments of the debate were those when other candidates tried to point that out directly or indirectly  Chris Christie did so several times  During his opening remarks  he asked the camera to move from him to the audience  saying that the election isn’t really about the candidates  who soak up the spotlight  but the people  who deal with the consequences He returned to that idea after Trump and Fiorina wrangled over her past performance as the chief executive of Hewlett Packard  an exchange that followed much tussling over Trump’s business bona fides “While I’m as entertained as anyone by this personal back and forth about the history of Donald and Carly’s career  for the 55 year old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn’t have a job  who can’t fund his child’s education  I’ve got to tell you the truth — they could care less about your careers ” Christie said to Trump and Fiorina “You’re both successful people ” he continued  “Congratulations ” But then he pleaded that there be more discussion of issues and an end to “this childish back and forth between the two of you ”Mike Huckabee built on that  bemoaning “a lot of back and forth about ‘I’m the only one who has done this  the only one who has done that  I’ve done great things ’ We’ve all done great things or we wouldn’t be on this stage ”During the second half of the debate in particular  the conversation moved far enough away from Trump for all of the candidates to strut their stuff  for whatever that stuff was worth But because there were 11 of them  those struts were so brief and sporadic that I don’t think anyone’s fortunes will be significantly changed Marco Rubio showed great confidence about foreign affairs  Fiorina’s crispness came through  John Kasich seemed to vanish for long chunks but  when present  managed to be both avuncular and authoritative  an effective  appealing combination Cruz predictably won the awards for Most Strident and Most Smarmy  talking directly to the camera rather than whoever had asked him a question  Carson was the anti Trump  as docile as Trump was domineering  and he brilliantly sought to re educate Trump on vaccines Did Bush find some spine and spark? Yes  but he seemed to fumble for it  He picked a fight with Trump about casinos in Florida  He spoke succinctly about his brother’s administration  no longer pantomiming a deer in headlights  He made a marijuana joke and then another joke  about his energy level  saying that he’d want his Secret Service nickname to be “Eveready ” Like the battery But there remains something wan about him  In a season of such garish colors  he always looks a little pale He’s not enough of a clown  and Trump has done his best to turn this into a circus  erasing the blurry line between entertainment and politics and beckoning commentators and networks toward uncharted summits of breathlessness “It is electric ” Anderson Cooper said to Wolf Blitzer in the hours before the debate began  describing the atmosphere “It doesn’t get much bigger than this ” Blitzer said to Cooper  and he repeatedly interrupted the pundits around him to provide updates on whether Trump had been spotted yet at the Reagan library  where the debate was held “Donald Trump  we’re told  is arriving ” Blitzer trumpeted at one point  minutes later adding  “Hold on  Hold on        He’s walking in right now ” The camera documented it  step after step Were we supposed to get goose bumps?

summer of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s discontent continued on the Sunday talk shows  as the political class continued to chew on the challenges facing her candidacy — including the continuing investigation into her private email  the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire  and the potential threat of a candidacy from Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  Mr  Sanders  whose campaign has been almost entirely focused on economic issues  stopped by NBC News’s “Meet the Press” to show off his foreign policy chops Looking ahead to the second Republican presidential debate on Wednesday  candidates and pundits pontificated about a divided party swept up in the anti establishment charisma of Donald J  Trump and the quiet religiousness of Ben Carson  who has climbed in the polls lately and on Sunday coolly defended himself against Mr  Trump’s claim that he lacked energy Ben Carson“I am not specifically going after Trump supporters  I am going after everyone in America ” Mr  Carson said on ABC News’s “This Week ” “If we don’t begin to change our direction and change our attitude  I think we may not survive into the future ”He said his comments questioning Mr  Trump’s faith were not meant as an insult  though he said  “it was certainly spun that way by the media because they enjoy creating a fight ”In response to Mr  Trump’s comments that he lacked energy  which Mr  Trump has also said of Jeb Bush   an almost eerily measured Mr  Carson replied  “It doesn’t bother me because I recognize I have plenty of energy  operating on people for 10  12  sometimes 20 hours at a time  You don’t have to be loud to be energetic ” Senator Bernie SandersMr  Sanders’s message about income inequality and taking on Wall Street has resonated with Democratic voters  but as Chuck Todd of NBC News pointed out on Sunday  his foreign policy positions are not widely known Asked about how many Syrian refugees the United States should shelter  Mr  Sanders declined to say  “It’s impossible to give a proper number until we understand the dimensions of the problem ” he said   That differs from the position of former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  who is also seeking the Democratic nomination and last week called on the United States to accept at least 65 000 refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq  Mr  Sanders reminded Mr  Todd that he voted against authorizing military force in Iraq in 2002 — which Mrs  Clinton has said she regretted supporting  “What I feared would happen  in fact  did happen  mass destabilization in the region ” he said But Mr  Sanders did not present himself as the antiwar candidate and said he was not against the use of force in all circumstances  He voted to authorize the war in Afghanistan  “I believed that Osama bin Laden needed to be captured  needed to be brought to trial ” Mr  Sanders said  Gov  Chris Christie Mr  Christie  the New Jersey governor  whose presidential prospects have dimmed amid political scandals in his home state  took a jab at Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York  who previously worked for Mrs  Clinton but has yet to endorse his former boss  “When I sat and watched Bill de Blasio the other day talk about how it’s safer in New York City ” Mr  Christie said on NBC News  “it’s ironic that the only person who thinks it is safer in New York City are guys who are walking around with armed guards all the time ”Gov  John KasichMr  Kasich  the Ohio governor and a relative latecomer to the Republican field  attempted to prove his conservative credentials  “I would build the wall” on the Mexican border  he told Fox News  “I’d make it clear that anybody who tries to make it over that wall  ‘No more excuses  you’re going back ’ ”When asked about his previous comments about an increase to the federal minimum wage and whether he supported what President Obama and other Democrats have pushed for  Mr  Kasich pushed back  “I fundamentally believe it ought to be done at the state level ” he said  “That’s what I believe ”Donald J  TrumpIn a preview of the tactics he might bring to the Republican debate on Wednesday night  Mr  Trump  speaking on CBS News’s “Face the Nation ” criticized Carly Fiorina’s business record and said his widely criticized comments about her face had been taken out of context  “I was talking about her persona ” Mr  Trump said  “She had tremendously  you could call it bad luck  you could call it she did a bad job  but Hewlett Packard was a disaster  And Lucent  the company she was at before Hewlett Packard  was a disaster ”Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   in spiritAcross all the Sunday news programs  pundits picked apart whether Mr  Biden would enter the Democratic contest and discussed his searing interview with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” last week  when he discussed  with agonizing grief in his voice  the death of his 46 year old son  Beau Biden Mrs  Clinton’s supporters have publicly said that Mr  Biden’s entry could help her emerge from the Democratic race battle tested  But Ron Fournier of National Journal wasn’t buying it  When asked on “Meet the Press” whether Mr  Biden would help Mrs

is grappling with a difficult question  How can she contrast herself with Bernie Sanders in next week’s Democratic presidential debate and beyond  without employing the sort of attacks that could boomerang to harm her?For months  Mrs  Clinton has gingerly approached Mr  Sanders  the Vermont senator  who has routinely drawn tens of thousands of Democrats to his rallies and who is rivaling her in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire voters  She has seldom mentioned his name  let alone criticized him But while Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  may be a looming threat  Mr  Sanders poses more immediate concerns to Mrs  Clinton and her aides Many Democrats believe that Mr  Sanders  an independent who calls himself a democratic socialist  will prove too far left leaning to capture the nomination  despite his popularity at this stage  But the growing chance that he could win either Iowa or New Hampshire  or both  has raised the stakes for the debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas Over the next week  Mrs  Clinton and her aides will look for the best way to explain to viewers why she is a better choice than her nearest rival without sounding condescending to Mr  Sanders  or dismissive of his views  so she does not risk alienating his growing army of supporters “I’ve seen every attack people have thrown at him  and none of them have worked ” cautioned Howard Dean  the former governor of Vermont  who supports Mrs  Clinton Not all of them have been exactly subtle  In 2004  the Republican challenging him for his House seat sought to deride him as a political oddball  “Crazy Bernie ” an advertisement called him  “a holdover from the Woodstock days of reefer and flowers ” But Vermont voters did not seem to mind Attacking Mr  Sanders’s character or lampooning his self description as a democratic socialist  Mr  Dean suggested  will only “make him stronger  especially with his base — and we need his base ”Mrs  Clinton is unlikely to belittle Mr  Sanders  But her debate preparations have touched on  among other things  how Mr  Sanders would accomplish some of his ambitious proposals if he was elected president  according to three people briefed on the private discussions   Mr  Sanders’s spending proposals — free public college tuition  a  1 trillion infrastructure program and a single payer health care system — would be financed with a variety of tax increases  both would be nonstarters under a Republican controlled Congress  The practice sessions are also covering a number of issues in which Mrs  Clinton’s positions or her record are at odds with Mr  Sanders’s  including gun control  said the three people who were briefed Led by Ron Klain  a former Biden aide  and Karen Dunn  a litigator  the debate preparations have featured Mrs  Clinton’s longtime lawyer  Robert Barnett  in the role of Mr  Sanders and her policy adviser Jake Sullivan playing Martin O’Malley  the former Maryland governor  Mr  Barnett and aides to Mrs  Clinton declined to comment  and Mr  Sullivan could not be reached For Mrs  Clinton  debating Mr  Sanders poses a challenge reminiscent of the more troublesome one she faced in 2008  when Senator Barack Obama’s criticisms of her were widely characterized as fair  but Mrs  Clinton’s efforts to counter them and defend herself often were not Already  a “super PAC” supporting Mrs  Clinton showed the risks that can come if an unsuccessful attack on Mr  Sanders blows back  As The Huffington Post reported  the super PAC  Correct the Record  in a document that was intended to be off the record  drew a connection between Mr  Sanders and Hugo Chávez  the socialist president of Venezuela who died in 2013  because Mr  Sanders supported a deal to bring low cost Venezuelan oil to New England  Mr  Sanders  calling it “the same old  same old negative politics ” seized on the report and raised more than  1 million in two days Beyond the debate  neither Mrs  Clinton nor Mr  Sanders has ruled out resorting to negative advertisements in the months ahead  though both have insisted they would prefer to avoid them “I know Bernie ” Mrs  Clinton said on “Face the Nation” on CBS recently  “I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas  That’s what I want this campaign to be about ”Mr  Sanders has been drawing his own implicit contrasts with Mrs  Clinton for months — which  without naming her  leave little to the imagination  “If you think establishment politics and establishment economics is the answer to our problems  fine  there are good candidates out there ” he told David Axelrod  the former adviser to President Obama  in a podcast recently  repeating a familiar formulation pregnant with faint praise Whether next week’s debate veers off from faint praise into out and out hostility will  in many ways  set the tone for the Democratic battle until February’s Iowa caucuses For Mrs  Clinton  the challenge may be to outdo Mr  Sanders at his own game  rather than to embarrass him  Mr  Axelrod suggested in an interview “Looking forward  it seems far better to co opt the spirit of Bernie’s message than to attack him ” he said  “Better to be a champion for fairness and opportunity  and tackle the issue of how to raise wages in a country where they have effectively flatlined for decades  than to kneecap a guy who is relatively popular and is running a positive campaign

first person Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont met when he climbed out of a Dodge Journey here on a recent Saturday morning was Caleb Humphrey  It was for good reason “Senator  this week alone Caleb made 2 016 calls ” a campaign organizer said  introducing Mr  Humphrey “Oh  my God ” Mr  Sanders said  looking genuinely shocked  “Thank you very much for that ”As Mr  Sanders walked into the hall for another packed rally  Mr  Humphrey  a 30 year old Army veteran  explained why he had made so many calls urging Iowans to come to the event “I haven’t felt anything like this in the three years I have been out of the Army ” he said of Mr  Sanders’s unlikely and rising campaign for the Democratic nomination  “I feel a part of something ”Support for Mr  Sanders has surged around the country  and he has drawn crowds that are the envy of other candidates  But it is Mr  Sanders’s footprint in Iowa  that most critical of early states  where that expansion matters most  A new Des Moines Register poll shows that Mr  Sanders now trails Hillary Rodham Clinton  the Democratic front runner  by only seven points in Iowa  where he will return for another campaign sweep on Thursday The Sanders campaign made its first hire here on May 18  an advance director with a history in student organizing  A field organizer came on next  followed by an administrative staff member  all in the campaign’s one office in Des Moines  Then  as Mr  Sanders became a national phenomenon over the summer  his Iowa operation bloomed It now has 53 people on staff  with a “robust hiring plan” made possible by Mr  Sanders’s fund raising success with small donors  according to his campaign manager  Jeff Weaver  This past weekend alone  he said  the campaign’s 1 700 volunteers marched out of 15 campaign offices throughout the state to knock on 17 000 doors and make 10 000 phone calls They call it Bern Storming Mr  Sanders also has a growing presence in other primary states  and is putting staff in Nevada  But for a Vermont independent senator with radical political roots  no experience in national politics and little establishment backing  the key has been attracting more than 140 000 volunteers who have registered online Mr  Sanders and his campaign say their main logistical challenge now is building an infrastructure that matches the momentum seen in polls and rallies “We had assumed there would be a more gradual ramp up ” Mr  Weaver said In Iowa  the campaign is hiring professionals to coordinate volunteers and their canvassing activities  but also to better build what Mr  Weaver called a “geographically diverse” base of support in the state  Already attracting young voters  the campaign is confident that older voters will also gravitate toward Mr  Sanders as they learn more about the 73 year old’s positions on access to cheaper prescription drugs and on Social Security While Mrs  Clinton has an impressive Iowa organization  Mr  Weaver said that had not meant all the talent was locked up  With so many veterans of past Democratic campaigns available  there is a “whole cadre of people who are not in the Clinton world ” he said And the campaign has inherited some key operatives who worked for President Obama  Scott Goodstein  the founder of Revolution Messaging  which is handling the digital operation for the Sanders campaign  ran social media efforts for Mr  Obama’s 2008 campaign  Zack Exley  who joined the campaign in August  also did work for Mr  Obama’s 2008 campaign  And the president’s former site architect and videographer are also on board That is not to say the campaign’s field operatives sell themselves short  Mention the lack of a figure like David Plouffe  the organizing force behind Mr  Obama’s campaigns  and Pete D’Alessandro  the campaign’s Iowa director  says  “That’s me ”Mr  D’Alessandro  the campaign’s second hire in the state and a former organizer for former Gov  Chet Culver  said the major crowds out West had energized volunteers in Iowa  who watched feeds of the events at campaign pizza parties He added that larger events in nearby states also expanded the volunteer base  and that the campaign had asked supporters in Madison  Wis   where Mr  Sanders drew a crowd of 10 000  to come knock on doors in Dubuque “More foot soldiers ” he said When Mr  Sanders showed up for the opening of his campaign headquarters in Marion  Iowa  the response was so large that organizers added another speech  said Matt Burge  a volunteer who collected cards on which supporters committed to caucus for Mr  Sanders “Seeing his momentum grow and grow makes it a lot easier” to get commitments  he said The crowds have become such a point of pride for the Sanders campaign that when Mr  Weaver spoke to a reporter in the vestibule of an intimate meeting with union members in Clinton  he half apologized for its size  “I’m told that this is how they used to do events before the Bernie Sanders phenomenon ” he said Supporters at Sanders events around the country say they learn about them from Facebook  the candidate’s own website or Reddit  where Mr  Sanders announced his bid on the Sanders for President message board  which now has 95 000 followers “We’re in communication” with the campaign  said Aidan King  23  a co founder of the Reddit page who works in a Vermont based winery  He said campaign had given the page a heads up about the Madison event because it was its first test for drawing a big crowd The Reddit page administrators responded by disseminating information on how to R S V P  for the event with the Sanders campaign and then provided a forum to organize transportation That is an enthusiasm that Mr  Sanders — the self styled substance candidate — is using as his principal talking point on the trail  And no matter where he goes  the crowds only help him generate more interest in Iowa  And in Iowa  he and his campaign make sure they get what they need from the crowds “The bad news is ”

No What is your elevator pitch for socialism? My elevator pitch is that the United States has a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality where the top one tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent  where almost 20 percent of our children are living in poverty  40 percent of African American children are living in poverty  We are moving rapidly toward an oligarchic form of society where a small number of families control not only the economy but our political system as well  It is imperative that we develop a strong political movement that says to the billionaire class they cannot have it all A recent poll showed that Americans are more willing to vote for a Muslim or an atheist for president than a socialist  Do you think you could take back the word ‘‘socialism’’ and keep it from being what it is right now  which is almost a nasty word? Actually  what surprised me about that poll was  given the negative publicity that the word ‘‘socialism’’ has  that — what was the number of the people who were prepared to vote for a socialist?It was in the high 40s  Yeah  Well  that’s pretty good  and it’ll get higher One of the few clear ideas that Americans have about socialism is that it involves high taxes  Can you sell that  the idea that you might have to raise taxes? I think we can sell the idea that when the rich are getting much richer and corporations are enjoying record breaking profits that yes  they should start paying their fair share of taxes Are you familiar with the hashtag  Bernie­SoBlack? I’ve heard of it A lot of black activists felt as if  when they criticized you  the response they got back was ‘‘but he marched on Washington ’’ as though that were an absolution  And so it became this joke on Twitter  ‘‘Bernie’s so black  he’s the first one killed in horror movies ’’ ‘‘Bernie’s so black  he’s dropping a mix tape ’’ Well look  Black Lives Matter is a very  very serious issue  And clearly  as a nation  we have to move away from a situation where black women are dragged out of their cars  thrown to the ground  assaulted and then die in jail three days later for the crime of not signaling a lane change  Or more recently  a fellow named Samuel DuBose got shot in the head for the crime of not having a license plate on the front of his car Were you surprised that black activists responded so negatively to you at first? Yes  I was  because I think if you check the record  you will find that I have one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress  and this is an issue I feel strongly about What do you think of Donald Trump’s surge in the polls? Not much  I think Donald Trump’s views on immigration and his slurring of the Latino community is not something that should be going on in the year 2015  and it’s to me an embarrassment for our country Do you think it’s fair that Hillary’s hair gets a lot more scrutiny than yours does? Hillary’s hair gets more scrutiny than my hair?Yeah  Is that what you’re asking?Yeah  O K   Ana  I don’t mean to be rude here  I am running for president of the United States on serious issues  O K ? Do you have serious questions?I can defend that as a serious question  There is a gendered reason — When the media worries about what Hillary’s hair looks like or what my hair looks like  that’s a real problem  We have millions of people who are struggling to keep their heads above water  who want to know what candidates can do to improve their lives  and the media will very often spend more time worrying about hair than the fact that we’re the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people It’s also true that the media pays more attention to what female candidates look like than it does to what male candidates look like  That may be  That may be  and it’s absolutely wrong ","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders Has Heard About That Hashtag","content_kicker":"Talk","kicker":"Talk","print_headline":"Bernie Sanders Has Heard About That Hashtag"},"wordCount":"706"},

nearly all of the money she raised during the last three months while raising far less than she did previously  according to fund raising figures released by her campaign on Thursday  and she enters the fall campaign with a substantially smaller cash advantage over her closest rival  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont Mrs  Clinton  a Democrat who has been able to tap into one of the most successful fund raising networks in American politics  reported raising more than  28 million for her primary campaign since the beginning of July  and spent about 90 percent of it  ending with  32 million on hand But during a summer when insurgent candidates in both parties rose to the forefront of the campaign  Mr  Sanders  a socialist who has held just a handful of formal fund raisers  brought in more than  26 million and began October with about the same amount of cash on hand  according to his campaign Ben Carson  a Republican and retired neurosurgeon who has emerged as a favorite of religious conservatives in states like Iowa and South Carolina  raised  20 million from 353 000 donors  according to his aides  Like Mr  Sanders  he increased the pace of his fund raising from the spring  but he ended with far less money in the bank  about  12 million The preliminary fund raising numbers reflected a rapidly shifting political landscape in which well financed candidates who are favored by their party’s establishment and big donors  like Mrs  Clinton and Jeb Bush  are being challenged aggressively by political outsiders Mr  Bush and Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas  leaders of Republican fund raising last quarter  did not release numbers on Thursday  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky raised just  2 5 million for his presidential campaign  an aide said  and spent almost twice as much  beginning October with about  2 million in his war chest But the shrinking gap between Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders — comparable to Mrs  Clinton’s lead over Barack Obama  then a senator  during the same period in the 2008 campaign — was particularly striking  indicating that Mr  Sanders may have the money and resources to campaign next year beyond Iowa and New Hampshire  where most of his resources have been devoted “What it tells us is that Bernie has financial staying power ” Jeff Weaver  Mr  Sanders’s campaign manager  said  “We have the financial wherewithal that will allow for a major campaign through Iowa  New Hampshire  South Carolina  Nevada and beyond in state by state  delegate by delegate contests for the Democratic Party nomination ”Aides to Mrs  Clinton said that her total was within their projections  and that aside from incumbent presidents  no candidate had raised as much during the comparable three months of a campaign But the amount Mrs  Clinton raised reflected a sharp drop from her haul reported over her few months in the race  when she brought in a total of  47 5 million  almost all of it for the primary campaign  The decrease reflects not only the usual summer slowdown on the fund raising circuit but also the growing possibility that another Democrat popular among the party’s major donors  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   might enter the race The coming months will test whether Mrs  Clinton’s high rate of spending will pay dividends against Mr  Sanders and other competitors  A Clinton aide said the money had gone largely to early investments in field infrastructure  including gathering data on grass roots supporters  the heart of a modern presidential campaign  Mr  Sanders’s  15 million in spending was devoted largely to online fund raising and hiring staff  his aides said Mr  Carson’s aides declined to share information on his spending  but in the first two months of his campaign  half of it went to direct mail or telephone solicitations  relatively costly ways to raise money Precise information on the candidates’ spending won’t be made public until they file reports with the Federal Election Commission later this month  But there is little evidence that Mrs  Clinton or Mr  Sanders has invested significantly beyond the first four states on the Democratic calendar And Mr  Sanders has spent virtually nothing on some traditional campaign expenses  such as television ads or polling  even as he ascended in some national and state polls  Mrs  Clinton  by contrast  spent about  4 million on television ads over the summer Most important  Mr  Sanders is rapidly rewriting the rules for big money fund raising in a presidential campaign  He raised the money with only a small number of fund raising events and appears to be relying overwhelmingly on donors’ making small contributions Mr  Sanders has even outpaced Mr  Obama’s record breaking campaign from 2008  reaching more than a million online contributions — a mark Mr  Obama did not pass until the Democratic primaries were underway in the winter of 2008  according to Obama fund raising solicitations at the time  Mr  Sanders has also amassed 650 000 contributors  well more than Mr  Obama had at the comparable point in that campaign cycle “Sanders is proving  at least for now  that presidential candidates can compete financially in the primary solely with contributions from everyday Americans ” said David Donnelly  the president of Every Voice  which advocates programs to encourage small donor political giving  “That he’s doing it with a critique of the big money system at the core of his message is an important part of his success ”Mrs  Clinton has relied on the full force and reach of one of the most prominent Democratic politicians in the world  rousing small donors but also investing far more time and energy than Mr  Sanders in courting those who can give the maximum  2 700 for her primary campaign She attended at least 58 fund raisers in the past three months  according to her campaign schedules  and sent her husband  former President Bill Clinton  or top aides to others The question for the Democratic hopefuls is which candidate can sustain his or her pace  Mr  Sanders’s haul represents about 10 percent more a month in the third quarter than in the second  when he first entered the race  a relatively small increase  His aides said he had about  25 million on hand after spending about  15 million through the campaign  mostly on online fund raising efforts and a growing staff in New Hampshire  Iowa and elsewhere But Mrs  Clinton has at least one substantial edge  “Super PACs” supporting her candidacy and staffed by her allies have raised an additional tens of millions of dollars Mr  Sanders’s surge may now force an uncomfortable choice for Mrs  Clinton’s allies  whether to open those floodgates against Mr  Sanders  who has told supporters he does not want a super PAC of his own ","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders Narrows Fund-Raising Gap With Hillary Clinton","print_headline":"Sanders Shrinks Gap With Clinton in

How can social conservatives support a thrice married sybarite? How can anyone who mocked the celebrity element in Obama’s 2008 campaign embrace the host of Celebrity Apprentice?But if you’re looking for the candidate whose polling surge looks most like a march of voter folly  the Donald and his Trumpistas wouldn’t be the place I’d start  Instead  I would pick the Ben Carson phenomenon  and the evangelical Christians who increasingly form the core of his support Though Carson is running close to Trump in Iowa and rising nationally  he’s attracted a fraction of the scrutiny  and his supporters have earned a fraction of the political class’s scorn  To some extent this is understandable  since Carson is temperamentally nonflamboyant  with none of Trump’s insult comic style  He’s decent  modest  soft spoken  devout  with an astonishing biography and an admirable character But the growing evangelical embrace of Carson is arguably a greater folly than Trumpmania  That’s because the Donald  for all his proud ignorance about policy detail  is actually running an ideologically distinctive campaign  He’s a populist and nationalist  a critic of open immigration and free trade and a backer of Social Security and progressive taxation  and he’s drawing support from working class Republicans who tend to share those views The Trump phenomenon  then  isn’t just a study in celebrity besotted conservative delusion  or a case of evangelicals betraying their faith to chase a shiny object   Despite what you may have read  Trump isn’t particularly popular with religious voters   It’s a class revolt  driven by a sadly justifiable sense that Republican elites don’t have working class interests close enough to heart  And it’s already won some  very  modest victories for populism — by prodding Scott Walker to make an economic case against low skilled immigration  for instance  or by encouraging Jeb Bush to go after hedge fund managers in his tax plan Carson  on the other hand  is running a more content free campaign  Like Trump  he’s underinformed and prone to wild rhetorical flights  but unlike the Donald he doesn’t have a distinctive platform  He’s offering a collection of pieties and crankery  mostly  his candidacy is just about the man himself And unfortunately evangelical voters have a weakness for this kind of pitch  From Pat Robertson in 1988 through thin on policy figures like Mike Huckabee  Sarah Palin  even Michele Bachmann briefly in 2012  the evangelical tendency has been to look for a kind of godly hero  a Christian leader who could win the White House and undo every culture war defeat   The resilience of evangelical support for George W  Bush as his presidency went sour reflected a persistent hope that Bush might be this hero in the flesh  Such unrealistic ideas are hardly unique to the religious right  But evangelical culture  as James Davison Hunter notes in “To Change the World ” his magisterial account of recent Christian engagement with American politics  has a particular fondness for the idea of the history altering individual  the hope that “one person can stand at the crossroads and change things for good ”As Hunter’s book points out  neither political nor cultural change usually happens like this  Instead  it comes from networks  institutions  interest groups  and it requires strategy  alliance building and steady pressure This is part of why evangelical Christians  notwithstanding their numbers  tend to have less influence over actual Republican governance than fiscal conservatives or foreign policy hawks  They’re always looking for a hero  or heroine   while the party’s other factions focus on staffing decisions and policy commitments  where the real work of politics takes place In this election cycle  though  the evangelical hero quest is particularly self defeating  With same sex marriage established nationwide and social liberalism ascendant  religious conservatives have a clear policy “ask” they should be pressing every major Republican contender to embrace  They need guarantees that the next G O P  administration will move proactively — through something like Senator Mike Lee’s evolving First Amendment Defense Act — to protect religious schools and charities from losing grants or accreditation or even tax exempt status because they maintain a traditional position on sexual ethics I’m sure that a President Ben Carson would deliver these protections  I’m equally sure that the longer the fantasy of a Carson presidency persists  the less likely it becomes that religious conservatives will get them ","headline":{"main":"Evangelicals and the Carson Illusion","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"The Carson Illusion"},"wordCount":"802"},

H  —  Hillary Rodham Clinton turned to New Hampshire Democratic officials and county leaders on Saturday for help in fighting the surging campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  who holds a steady lead over her in state opinion polls in the 2016 presidential primary race It was Mr  Sanders  speaking after Mrs  Clinton at the state party’s annual convention here  who received more ecstatic cheers from the crowd  as he denounced big banks  trade deals  tax breaks for the wealthy and “super PACs” like the one supporting Mrs  Clinton’s candidacy “Well  it certainly sounds like some people are ready for a political revolution ” Mr  Sanders said to shouts of “We love you  Bernie ”While Mrs  Clinton received an enthusiastic reception  with people beating inflatable noisemaker sticks that her well financed campaign passed out  the ovation for Mr  Sanders was striking because he is not a party member  he is a democratic socialist  and has far fewer endorsements than Mrs  Clinton from members of the state political apparatus  The convention drew about 1 000 delegates  many of them traditional politicians and elected officials not unlike Mrs  Clinton  and 3 000 other participants  many of them longtime avowed liberals like Mr  Sanders He acknowledged that he had come a long way since joining the race nearly four months ago  when he had a fraction of the support of Mrs  Clinton in the polls “What looked like a fringe campaign is now seen as a campaign that is standing up for working Americans  that is prepared to take on the billionaire class ” Mr  Sanders said  “I don’t want their money  I don’t want a super PAC  We’re going to do it on our own ”Mrs  Clinton  by contrast  highlighted recent endorsements from the state’s governor  Maggie Hassan  and Democratic senator  Jeanne Shaheen  and at various points mentioned her husband  former President Bill Clinton  a popular figure with Democrats here  Mr  Clinton  in his 1992 campaign  famously vowed to “be there for you ’till the last dog dies ” and Mrs  Clinton put her own spin on the sentiment “If you want a president who will listen to you  work her heart out to make your life better and together to build a stronger  fairer  better country  then you’re looking at her ” she said  drawing particular cheers from women as she emphasized the female pronoun She pledged to fight for equal pay for women and address income inequality  and again invoked her husband as an example of economic stewardship “When he got into the White House  he realized he had inherited real economic problems from his Republican predecessors — that seems to happen  have you noticed?” Mrs  Clinton said But she is not running on her husband’s coattails  she said  as she repeated a popular applause line from her stump speech  “I’m not running for my husband’s third term or President Obama’s third term  I’m running for my first term ” she said  in remarks that ran for about 40 minutes — twice as long as those of other candidates   One of them  Lawrence Lessig  a professor at Harvard Law School  gently chided her  noting that he would respect time limits for speakers  While the crowd applauded the attacks on Republican economic policies  some Democrats in the audience also displayed unhappiness with their own leaders  Scores of them heckled the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee  Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida  over the party’s decision to limit the number of debates for its presidential candidates to six — a decision that one candidate  former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  said was rigged to help Mrs  Clinton  At points they nearly drowned out Ms  Wasserman Schultz with “More debates ” and “We want debates ” and the chants grew so loud that she went off script and addressed them “What’s more important  driving the contrast with Republicans or arguing about debates?” Ms  Wasserman Schultz said  “Let’s focus on our task at hand ”She then tried to mollify the crowd by attacking a favorite target  the Republican candidate Donald J  Trump  for not correcting a man at a New Hampshire rally on Thursday who said Mr  Obama is a Muslim  The convention hall exploded in cheers  but the party unity did not last long  as the “More debates” catcalls resumed Still  Mr  Trump proved an easy source of applause that Democrats kept returning to “He’s been trafficking in prejudice and paranoia through this campaign ” Mrs  Clinton said  going on to give Democrats a retort to Mr  Trump’s campaign slogan  “When you hear Mr  Trump say  ‘Let’s make America great again ’ you respond  ‘America is great  We just need to make it work for all Americans ’ ”Mr  O’Malley drew one of his biggest ovations when he described Mr  Trump as “that racist  anti immigrant carnival barker” and blasted the Republican field for stoking the grievances of Americans “They can have their anger and their fear  but they cannot go unanswered ” Mr  O’Malley said  “Anger and fear never built a great country ”Mr  O’Malley  in his remarks  did not dwell on the issue of Democratic debates  but he made his case for more of them during a news conference afterward  He noted that the New Hampshire Democratic face off was scheduled for the Saturday before Christmas  one of the busiest shopping days of the year  when few voters might be inclined to watch the televised debate “I think everyone in the party realizes we should not let the Republican debates go unanswered ” Mr  O’Malley told reporters after his speech ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton and

fury rising over the high cost of prescription drugs  Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed capping out of pocket drug expenses at  250 a month on Tuesday while a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  extolled his own plan and long record for pushing to lower drug costs While Republican candidates for the White House want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and generally oppose interfering with the drug industry  Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders are competing fiercely with each other to press for greater competition and new regulations to rein in pharmaceutical companies  Mrs  Clinton announced her patient spending cap as part of a plan that includes requiring most drug makers to spend a defined portion of their profits on research and development  ending tax breaks for pharmaceutical advertising and allowing Americans to import lower priced drugs from other countries “It has gotten to the point where people are being asked to pay not just hundreds but thousands of dollars for a single pill ” said Mrs  Clinton  who laid out her proposals at a forum in Iowa  where she and Mr  Sanders are running closely in opinion polls for the first in the nation caucuses  “That is not the way the market is supposed to work  That is bad actors making a fortune off of people’s misfortune ”Even before Mrs  Clinton spoke  Mr  Sanders issued a statement reiterating his proposals  made early this month  including letting people buy drugs from Canada and allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies over prices  which is also in her plan   He also noted that he has backed medication purchases from Canada since 1999  before Mrs  Clinton joined the Senate On Monday  Mrs  Clinton helped cause biotechnology stocks to fall after she posted on Twitter  criticizing “price gouging” in the drug market  specifically referring to one company’s sudden decision to raise the price of a 62 year old drug to  750 a tablet from  13 50   She repeated the story in Iowa on Tuesday   The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fell more than 4 percent on Monday on fears that government action to control pharmaceutical prices could be coming On Tuesday  the index fell more modestly but had recovered somewhat by the end of the day  Wall Street analysts said that many of the proposals were unlikely to be enacted with Republicans controlling Congress  even if Mrs  Clinton became president “Bottom line is  politically this doesn’t happen ” Terry Haines  Washington analyst for the investment bank Evercore ISI  told clients on a webcast The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  which represents the country’s leading drug makers  said in a statement that Mrs  Clinton’s plan would “turn back the clock on medical innovation ”“These sweeping and far reaching proposals would restrict patients’ access to medicines  result in fewer new treatments for patients  cost countless jobs across the country and erode our nation’s standing as the world leader in biomedical innovation ” the statement said Some health economists warned that her new government mandate for company spending on medical research could create perverse incentives that could raise instead of lower the costs of developing drugs “This is an astonishingly naïve approach ” Amitabh Chandra  a professor of public policy at Harvard University  said in an email  He argued that the plan could encourage wasteful research spending without necessarily doing much about the prices charged for medications Several provisions in the plan are designed to change the way pharmaceutical companies structure their businesses  The proposal to establish a set ratio between revenue and research spending  and another that would eliminate the tax deductibility of drug marketing expenses  are clearly aimed at directing the companies to invest more heavily in research than selling their products “How can you get the focus to be more on research and less on getting people to take medicines they don’t need?” asked David Cutler  a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who has advised the Obama administration  He described the Clinton plan as “imperfect” but expected that it would shift drug company priorities Other parts of her plan were focused more narrowly on drug prices  One would reduce the amount of time a biologic drug could keep exclusivity  before cheaper copycat products could enter the market  Biologic drugs are different from typical medicines  because they are manufactured from living cells instead of chemicals  That provision would not affect the prices of biologic drugs when they first enter the market  but would limit the drug makers’ period of monopoly pricing Another would require drug makers to offer discounts to the federal government when it purchases drugs for patients in the Medicare and Medicaid programs  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the policy would save the government  103 billion over 10 years Like Mr  Sanders  Mrs  Clinton also endorses allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug makers for discounts  in the current system  competing private insurers each secure their own prices The Democratic candidates are feeling increasing pressure to develop answers for the problem of expensive prescription drugs  which recent polling shows is voters’ top health policy priority  It’s an issue that hits many households’ pocketbooks directly  as rising drug costs are being increasingly passed on to families Federal government data shows that drug spending rose substantially in 2014  after four relatively flat years While the Affordable Care Act  passed in 2010  has brought health insurance coverage to millions of people who did not have it  the law did little to change the way drugs are approved  sold or financed  Now  at the same time that drug prices have been rising  insurance plans have asked individuals to take on a greater share of the burden  A report from the Kaiser Family Foundation  published hours before Clinton’s health care address  documented the shift  Insurance deductibles in employer health plans have grown six times faster than wages since 2010 That means that more Americans are absorbing the cost of expensive drugs  and many are having difficulty affording the medicines Mrs  Clinton’s plan is aimed at addressing both sides of that equation  by trying to discourage drug companies from overcharging for their products while preventing insurance companies from passing along those high prices to consumers Mr  Sanders  by contrast  has urged a vast governmental shift in health care  proposing a Medicare for all single payer insurance system  Such an idea has never gained traction in Congress  leading Mr  Sanders to also pursue a separate strategy of trying to lower drug prices “The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people ” Mr  Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday  “The time is long overdue for Congress to listen to the needs of the American people and not the enormously profitable pharmaceutical industry ”Concerns about the cost of prescription drugs cross party lines  polls show  but the Republican presidential candidates have put forward fewer ideas to address it  One  Ben Carson  a retired neurosurgeon  said in an interview on Tuesday that he opposed “a whole new rash of regulations ”“Every regulation costs money in terms of goods and services  and who gets hit disproportionately with those costs?

comments that he lacked energy  which Mr  Trump has also said of Jeb Bush   an almost eerily measured Mr  Carson replied  “It doesn’t bother me because I recognize I have plenty of energy  operating on people for 10  12  sometimes 20 hours at a time  You don’t have to be loud to be energetic ” Senator Bernie SandersMr  Sanders’s message about income inequality and taking on Wall Street has resonated with Democratic voters  but as Chuck Todd of NBC News pointed out on Sunday  his foreign policy positions are not widely known Asked about how many Syrian refugees the United States should shelter  Mr  Sanders declined to say  “It’s impossible to give a proper number until we understand the dimensions of the problem ” he said   That differs from the position of former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  who is also seeking the Democratic nomination and last week called on the United States to accept at least 65 000 refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq  Mr  Sanders reminded Mr  Todd that he voted against authorizing military force in Iraq in 2002 — which Mrs  Clinton has said she regretted supporting  “What I feared would happen  in fact  did happen  mass destabilization in the region ” he said But Mr  Sanders did not present himself as the antiwar candidate and said he was not against the use of force in all circumstances  He voted to authorize the war in Afghanistan  “I believed that Osama bin Laden needed to be captured  needed to be brought to trial ” Mr  Sanders said  Gov  Chris Christie Mr  Christie  the New Jersey governor  whose presidential prospects have dimmed amid political scandals in his home state  took a jab at Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York  who previously worked for Mrs  Clinton but has yet to endorse his former boss  “When I sat and watched Bill de Blasio the other day talk about how it’s safer in New York City ” Mr  Christie said on NBC News  “it’s ironic that the only person who thinks it is safer in New York City are guys who are walking around with armed guards all the time ”Gov  John KasichMr  Kasich  the Ohio governor and a relative latecomer to the Republican field  attempted to prove his conservative credentials  “I would build the wall” on the Mexican border  he told Fox News  “I’d make it clear that anybody who tries to make it over that wall  ‘No more excuses  you’re going back ’ ”When asked about his previous comments about an increase to the federal minimum wage and whether he supported what President Obama and other Democrats have pushed for  Mr  Kasich pushed back  “I fundamentally believe it ought to be done at the state level ” he said  “That’s what I believe ”Donald J  TrumpIn a preview of the tactics he might bring to the Republican debate on Wednesday night  Mr  Trump  speaking on CBS News’s “Face the Nation ” criticized Carly Fiorina’s business record and said his widely criticized comments about her face had been taken out of context  “I was talking about her persona ” Mr  Trump said  “She had tremendously  you could call it bad luck  you could call it she did a bad job  but Hewlett Packard was a disaster  And Lucent  the company she was at before Hewlett Packard  was a disaster ”Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   in spiritAcross all the Sunday news programs  pundits picked apart whether Mr  Biden would enter the Democratic contest and discussed his searing interview with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” last week  when he discussed  with agonizing grief in his voice  the death of his 46 year old son  Beau Biden Mrs  Clinton’s supporters have publicly said that Mr  Biden’s entry could help her emerge from the Democratic race battle tested  But Ron Fournier of National Journal wasn’t buying it  When asked on “Meet the Press” whether Mr  Biden would help Mrs  Clinton  he said  simply  “No ”","headline":{"main":"Ben Carson and Bernie Sanders, on the Rise and on the Talk Shows","kicker":"First Draft"},"wordCount":"909"},

the retired neurosurgeon who has quietly arrived near the front of the Republican presidential field  is scooping up  100 000 a night from wealthy donors in Texas and California — evidence that he is fast transforming from a novelty candidate into one to be taken seriously by rivals and party leaders alike Trailing only Donald J  Trump in some national surveys  Mr  Carson and Jeb Bush  who is running third in some polls  will flank Mr  Trump at center stage in the second Republican debate at 8 p m  Wednesday on CNN  With more than  23 million at his disposal  according to his campaign  Mr  Carson has hired a staff of about 75  including 30 field organizers in seven states  seeking to carry him all the way to the Republican National Convention At the Aug  6 debate  Mr  Carson went long stretches without speaking  and apparently suffered from stage fright  before finishing with a rousing and funny riff on brain surgery  lamebrains in Washington and “the torch of freedom ” His minimalist but memorable performance helped uncork about  6 1 million in small donations last month  said Barry Bennett  Mr  Carson’s campaign manager  That was twice as much as he had raised in his best previous month If Mr  Carson has underwhelmed some political analysts  he has captivated ordinary Republican voters  especially religious conservatives  Some 50 000 people paid  25 each for a booklet about his life   50 donors got a child’s name put up on his campaign bus  and his campaign said it had raised  500 000 by selling signed and numbered portraits of him In all  nearly half a million people have contributed an average of  51 to Mr  Carson — a swell of small donor support exceeded in either party’s race only by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  an independent who is crusading against the influence of big money on politics as he seeks the Democratic nomination Like Mr  Sanders  Mr  Carson is a social media powerhouse  another sign of grass roots credibility  He has received almost 2 9 million page likes on Facebook  When he posts answers to supporters’ questions at night — “It had been my goal to conquer the organ in retirement ” he wrote recently — the comments routinely number in the thousands Unlike Mr  Sanders  though  Mr  Carson has nothing against big money  This month he began a stretch of more than 30 fund raising events from Bel Air in Los Angeles to South Carolina for donors willing to pay  500 to  2 700  the maximum gift to a candidate allowed by federal law The events were added to Mr  Carson’s schedule after he began surging in the polls  aides said  Earlier  big conservative donors had resisted Mr  Carson  said Doug Watts  a campaign spokesman  “They said  ‘Why don’t you prove your street cred first  and then we’ll be interested in making large donations ’ ” Mr  Watts said Having cleared that bar  Mr  Carson is hitting the private donor circuit in earnest  His goal   5 million by the end of October Jennifer Hohman  a co host of a fund raising dinner for Mr  Carson in Houston next month  said she was soliciting affluent supporters of social programs for the homeless or for children in foster care  in hopes of raising  250 000  “This is Bush land ” she said  but added  “There are a lot of Republican establishment givers who aren’t wanting to support the establishment ”One advantage of large donations is that they are less costly to raise  Soliciting small donations  especially by direct mail  can cost nearly as much as the money brought in  It is one reason Mr  Carson burned through 55 percent of the money he reported raising in the first half of the year  one of the fastest rates of any Republican Another apparent factor in Mr  Carson’s high rate of expenditures  his own luxury travel and splurging on musical acts for his campaign events A rivalry between Mr  Carson and Mr  Trump  both outsiders in a year of strong anti politician sentiments  could animate this week’s debate at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley  Calif  Mr  Carson has told advisers that he will be more outspoken than in the first debate On Saturday  Mr  Trump took a jab at Mr  Carson’s low key manner  doubting that he would be aggressive enough as president to represent American interests with foreign competitors  “I don’t think Ben has the energy ” Mr  Trump said Responding to the criticism Sunday on ABC’s “This Week ” Mr  Carson said  “It doesn’t bother me  because I recognize I have plenty of energy  operating on people for 10  12  sometimes for greater than 20 hours at a time ” He took his own poke at Mr  Trump  “You don’t have to be loud to be energetic ”Not long ago  Mr  Carson seemed the most far fetched of candidates  He had compared President Obama’s health care law to slavery and was disinvited to speak at Johns Hopkins  his former employer  over comments about gay people  But he has found a legitimacy in his party thanks to his embrace from conservative voters  especially evangelical Christians “Carson’s grass roots support gives him a staying power that many of the other candidates don’t have ” said Erick Erickson  the founder of RedState  an influential conservative blog  But the real tests lie ahead  he cautioned  “Ultimately  votes are more important than money ”Still  money can keep a candidate in the game a long time  including the support from “super PACs ” where Mr  Carson has also found success His first campaign manager  Terry Giles  resigned shortly after Mr  Carson announced his candidacy  and is planning to coordinate the super PACs supporting Mr  Carson  which already say they have raised nearly  20 million  And Mr  Giles just set up a nonprofit to promote Mr  Carson’s views using money from donors whose gifts can be unlimited  but whose identities can legally be kept secret “If you don’t have  100 million  you’re not going to be competitive in running for president ” said Mr  Giles  a Houston lawyer  “The process is completely out of control  That’s a tragedy  but that’s the reality ”One super PAC  the 2016 Committee  has raised  18 million from 148 000 donors  many of them Christian conservatives  said Chuck Muth  a spokesman for the group Mr  Trump  who boasts of his billions  has financed the bulk of his campaign himself so far  flying in a private helicopter to campaign appearances in Iowa and elsewhere  Mr  Bush  with  103 million in super PAC money behind him  has a significant lead on Mr  Carson in outside financial support But Carson campaign officials said in interviews that they were unconcerned “We think we have enough money to compete with anyone  even  100 million super PACs  all the way through the convention ” Mr  Watts  the campaign spokesman  said  “We’re not worried about money at all

deep antipathy that exists in the Republican Party toward politicians  consider that the three candidates leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination — Donald Trump  Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina — have zero years of governing experience among them In fact  for many Republican voters  governing experience appears to be downright disqualifying  even if you are highly accomplished  even if you have been a governor who is not complicit in any of the failures and dysfunction of Washington  According to a recent ABC News Washington Post poll  Republicans prefer an outsider to a candidate with experience in the political system by a 24 point margin  60 to 36   People who would never board an airplane piloted by a person who has never flown before  or even used a flight simulator  apparently want to elect as president someone who has never served in public office A phenomenon like this doesn’t arise ex nihilo  an ethos creates political openings that candidates  especially skillful manipulators of public opinion  can seize on  What’s happening right now is a reflection of the state of mind of Republican voters and bears close inspection  since it is shaping the narrative of the campaign This climate can’t be understood apart from the aftershock of President Obama’s winning re election  Republicans could rationalize his victory in 2008  Mr  Obama was something of a blank slate  he presented himself as a nonideological  unifying figure  and the financial crisis  which heightened in the months before the election  virtually ensured his triumph  That year  the stars aligned in just the right way for Democrats But by 2012  President Obama was viewed by Republicans as a complete failure whose repudiation was inevitable  The fact that he easily won re election  with 332 electoral votes to Mitt Romney’s 206  was a huge psychological blow to Republicans  much like the one Democrats experienced in 1984  when Ronald Reagan — despised by many liberals — won re election in a landslide The way this has worked itself out is in rage directed at Republican lawmakers  Many on the right refuse to recognize the institutional constraints that prevent lawmakers from doing what they want them to do  which is use their majority status in Congress to reverse the early achievements of the Obama presidency  One telling example  Advocates for the 2013 government shutdown insisted that doing so could fully defund the Affordable Care Act  when in fact no such thing was possible  Obamacare’s subsidies are an entitlement whose spending levels are not set by the annual appropriations process  meaning a shutdown could not unilaterally defund or eliminate it  No matter  with Republicans in control of the House and Senate  the Obama agenda was expected to be undone root and branch  The fact that it could not be undone created fury  As one friend recently wrote to me  with reference to Mr  Trump  “We are frustrated by the impotency of Republicans we have elected  Maybe this loudmouth boor can actually accomplish something ”Many grass roots Republicans feel abandoned by and alienated from the Republican leadership — a September Fox News poll shows 60 percent of Republicans feel betrayed by politicians from their own party — and Mr  Trump  Mr  Carson and Mrs  Fiorina have been the means by which they express their unhappiness  Since elected politicians have failed so miserably  why not look to outsiders to shake things up?But anger is not the only emotion coursing through Republican veins  There is also a widespread sense of doom  Republicans have spoken openly about feeling alienated from America  in part because of changing demographic trends  Rush Limbaugh  on the day after Mr  Obama’s re election  admitted  “I went to bed last night thinking we’re outnumbered  I went to bed last night thinking all this discussion we’d had about this election being the election that will tell us whether or not we’ve lost the country — I went to bed last night thinking we’ve lost the country  I don’t know how else you look at this ”Mr  Trump in particular gives voice to this feeling  declaring that “the American dream is dead” and that “our country is going to hell ” Ronald Reagan’s evocation of a shining city on a hill has been replaced by Mr  Trump’s decrepit castle on the rocks  Mr  Carson  for his part  recently declared Muslims unfit to be president  On several occasions he has compared the United States to Nazi Germany  the kind of thing one used to hear from the left More than at any point in recent times  then  the Republican Party — large parts of it  at least — is moving in the direction of insularity  defensiveness and discomfort with people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds  Many on the right now see things as a pitched battle between “us” and “the other ”All of this presents a serious threat to the Republican Party  A party that is already at a disadvantage in presidential elections is on course to alienate huge numbers of nonwhite voters  including some of the fastest rising demographic groups in America  Four years ago  Republican presidential candidates were talking about self deportation and electrified fences  today the front runner is talking about forced deportation  ending birthright citizenship and calling for a “pause” on green cards issued to foreign workers  The year 2012 was hardly a model when it came to appealing to nontraditional Republican voters  but this is a giant step in the wrong direction One way to correct this is by putting forward public policies that channel this anger toward constructive ends  that champions a conservative agenda to reform and modernize government in ways that better people’s everyday lives  There is no shortage of areas to focus on — our tax code and regulatory regime  our health care and entitlement systems  our schools and policies on energy and immigration  all of which are badly out of touch with the needs of our time  But temper of mind and disposition  the orientation of heart and spirit matter as well The struggle within the Republican Party right now centers on those who  figuratively speaking  want to rebuild the village and those who want to burn it down  those who want to fight irresistible demographic changes and those who want to responsibly embrace them  those who think they can win over new Americans and those who want to turn them away  There are a number of Republican presidential candidates — senators  governors and former governors — who  if given the chance  can make the Republican Party the party of aspiration instead of resentment  the party for this era instead of one seeking to reclaim a lost era In his autobiography  the Scottish novelist and former member of Parliament John Buchan wrote that he was “brought up in times when one was not ashamed to be happy  and I have never learned the art of discontent ” He added  “It seems to me that those who loudly proclaim their disenchantment with life have never been really enchanted by it ” Republican voters would be wise to choose leaders who embody enchantment rather than the art of discontent  who have known the uplands and can lead the rest of us there ","headline":{"main":"Seeking President, No Experience Necessary","content_kicker":"Contributing Op-Ed Writer","kicker":"Op-Ed | Peter

Carson this summer  While other presidential candidates shot flaming arrows at rivals and sometimes the news media  the soft spoken Mr  Carson seemed to struggle to be noticed  “Well  thank you ” he told moderators in the first Republican debate  “I wasn’t sure if I would get to speak again ”But while almost all Republicans were upstaged by the bombast of Donald J  Trump in recent months  Mr  Carson  a retired neurosurgeon whose low key personality and celebrated medical career are the antithesis of a politician’s usual path  gained ground as few seemed to notice A recent Quinnipiac University national poll showed him in second place in the Republican field  and a Monmouth University survey of Iowa Republicans released on Monday had him tied with Mr  Trump  Another Iowa poll  by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg  had the two candidates running closely within the poll’s margin of sampling error Like Mr  Trump  Mr  Carson has never held elected office  a quality that seems particularly prized by Republican voters this year  More than 90 percent of voters in the Register Bloomberg poll  conducted last week  said they were unsatisfied or “mad as hell” with government and politicians And yet  in almost every other way  Mr  Carson is Mr  Trump’s opposite  He is almost professorial  where Mr  Trump is loud  combative and unfiltered “At the end of the day  I attribute it to the power of nice ” said Rob Taylor  a chairman of Mr  Carson’s campaign in Iowa  reflecting on the rise of his candidate Mr  Carson has worked hard to tame his habit of making highly provocative statements  often on homosexuality  a move that advisers said had saved his campaign after it nearly derailed amid negative early headlines  They predicted that Mr  Trump’s own tendency toward such statements  whether directed at illegal immigrants or in personal attacks on Twitter  could undermine his headline grabbing run “We’ve been there and realize no matter how much the base will love you for it  people will not think it’s presidential ” said Armstrong Williams  a close adviser to Mr  Carson Mr  Carson’s campaign did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests to interview him A little known figure to most voters before the first Republican debate in Cleveland on Aug  6  Mr  Carson clearly benefited from the huge number of viewers who tuned in because of Mr  Trump’s flamboyance Mr  Carson spoke of separating conjoined twins and removing half a brain as qualifications for the Oval Office in his closing statement — made off the cuff  his advisers say  Many commentators shrugged  but social media lit up  Polling before and after the debate showed Mr  Carson with one of the biggest upticks His favorable rating among likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa was a towering 81 percent in the Monmouth University poll  with only 6 percent holding an unfavorable view Mr  Carson tied with Mr  Trump for the top spot in the poll at 23 percent  and pulled ahead of him with female voters and evangelical Christians “After more than a month of Trump winning virtually every Republican demographic group  we’ve finally got a little variation in voting blocs to talk about ” Patrick Murray  the director of the Monmouth Poll  said in a statement J  Ann Selzer  who conducted the Register Bloomberg poll  said  “While there are others who are playing for the religious right  so far it’s Carson who resonates ”Perhaps most surprising is that Mr  Carson’s appeal in Iowa is stronger than that of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  who has anti establishment credibility and recently drew more than 2 000 evangelicals to a rally in Des Moines A spokesman for Mr  Cruz  Rick Tyler  said Mr  Carson would have “to withstand the scrutiny of a front runner candidate” and “convince people he’s qualified to be president on foreign policy  economic policy and religious freedom policy ”The money for television ads and a campaign organization beyond the first nominating states will also be a challenge for Mr  Carson  Although he raised a respectable  10 6 million through the first half of the year  most of it was from small donors  who are costly to solicit through emails and direct mail  He has already burned through more than half the total money he has raised Being in the shadow of the Trump supernova for much of the summer may have saved Mr  Carson from sharper scrutiny over some statements he made  On a visit to the southern border  he called for the use of armed drones to target smugglers’ caves — a major policy shift from the current use of drones for surveillance only Mr  Carson  who first drew political notice by criticizing President Obama’s health care law at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013  favors repeal of the law  He favors a flat tax that can be filed in 15 minutes  The debate over global warming  he has said  is “irrelevant ” On many other issues  he has offered mostly general statements  but he plans to roll out detailed policies  including on immigration  after Labor Day Mr  Carson has also accused Planned Parenthood of opening most of its clinics in black neighborhoods “to control that population ” The statement was debunked by various news media fact checkers  including The Washington Post  which gave the claim “four Pinocchios ”Mr  Williams  the senior adviser to Mr  Carson  disputed that the statement was akin to earlier gaffes by Mr  Carson  arguing that Planned Parenthood’s founder  Margaret Sanger  had a “racist history ”“It’s a statement that can be argued back and forth ” he said The second Republican debate  on Sept  16 in Simi Valley  Calif   will be Mr  Carson’s next major turn on the national stage  He has promised his advisers that he will take advantage of his current momentum and be a more assertive presence than he was in Cleveland  He is planning a full day of debate preparation “You will see more fire in him ” Mr  Williams said  “He will not allow himself to be ignored ”","headline":{"main":"A Fellow Outsider, Ben Carson Rivals Donald Trump in Polls, if Not in Pomp","print_headline":"A Fellow Outsider, Carson Rivals Trump in Polls, if Not in

 helium is leaking from Ben Carson’s balloon and Scott Walker’s candidacy is on life support  according to the Republicans in Iowa who will cast the first votes of the nominating contest in less than five months Oh  and Donald J  Trump is still Donald J  Trump — what did you expect?A sampling of a dozen Iowans on Thursday who watched the second Republican debate — all of them close followers of the presidential race who are uncommitted — did not vary from the emerging national consensus about Mrs  Fiorina’s performance Perhaps the most surprising reaction was a feeling that Mr  Carson  who was on the heels of Mr  Trump in recent Iowa polls  did himself few favors on Wednesday by refusing to confront Mr  Trump  even on a medical issue like the purported link between vaccines and autism “Carson’s demeanor is beginning to make him look weak ” said Mary Whisenand  an insurance executive in Des Moines  “It isn’t that I think every presidential candidate needs to get out there and do hellfire and brimstone  but the optics are starting to work against him ”Others said Mr  Carson’s responses on policy issues  particularly national security  sounded mushy  John Wills  an Army veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  said that Mr  Carson was someone he had considered campaigning for  But no longer  He criticized Mr  Carson for his response to the question of what he would have done after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  “There are smart ways to do things and there are muscular ways to do things ” Mr  Carson said “I don’t know what that means ” said Mr  Wills  who was elected last year to the Iowa House in District 1  in the conservative northwest corner of the state  “If somebody attacks us and we respond by saying we’re going to use smart power  we put ourselves into a position of being not understood and taken seriously ”Mark A  Hanson  a supervisor for Dallas County  watched the debate with 100 supporters of Mr  Trump at a barbecue restaurant in West Des Moines  A Republican activist  Mr  Hanson said the Trump crowd seemed largely new to politics  and he wondered if many would show up to caucus in February  a typically low turnout event that draws party stalwarts  Interest in watching the debate  he said  faded after 20 minutes  “At the very beginning there was interest  but as the night went on they became very disinterested ” he said Tim Recker  a farmer in northeast Iowa  said he had been “really liking Trump ” But on Thursday he was questioning if Mr  Trump’s trade policies  including suggestions of raising tariffs on imported goods  would hurt agriculture exports “He made a comment about  We’re taking their stuff and giving beef back and they don’t even want it ” Mr  Recker said  “That’s not true  They love our beef ”Mr  Recker  who farms 1 600 acres of corn and soybeans in Arlington  close to the border with Wisconsin  said that Mr  Walker  the Wisconsin governor who once led Iowa polls but was in 10th place in a Quinnipiac University survey last week  left him feeling indifferent Mr  Walker had less speaking time in the CNN debate than any of the other 10 candidates  On a call with donors on Thursday  his campaign manager complained that CNN had asked Mr  Walker only a few questions  and Mr  Walker himself told donors he would now focus almost exclusively on Iowa  continuing his tour of all 99 counties In Lyon County in the northwest  Mr  Wills predicted that Mr  Walker could have a comeback “Trump is stealing the oxygen right now and that oxygen has depleted out of Walker  but people are willing to go back to Walker  I believe ” Mr  Wills said Like voters elsewhere  Iowans were impressed with Mrs  Fiorina’s icy comment to Mr  Trump about his criticism of her appearance  “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr  Trump said ” Mrs  Fiorina said when asked about Mr  Trump’s attempt to walk back a remark that no one would vote for her because of her looks “She hit it out of the park ” said C  Edward Brown  chief executive of the Iowa Clinic in Des Moines He added  “There’s going to be a lot more women paying attention to this lady  and consequently their husbands will too ”Phil Cavanaugh  a conservative whose favored candidates are Senator Ted Cruz  Mr  Carson and Mr  Trump  said he was disappointed when candidates  at the urging of moderators  attacked one another  “Notice that Ted Cruz and Ben Carson never did that ” he said  “They went ahead and said  This is what we need to do on the issues ”Mr  Cruz  who was third in recent Iowa polls behind Mr  Trump and Mr  Carson  “had a good night ” Mr  Cavanaugh said  “He’s not mentioned as much in the media even though he’s ahead of Carly  I think he’s a stronger  better candidate  Time will tell ”Jeb Bush  whose campaign once hoped to compete for business oriented Republicans in Iowa but has recently put more of his energy into New Hampshire  did not seem to make a strong enough impression to sway Iowans Mike McInerney  president of the Bull Moose Club in Des Moines  a political group for young Republican professionals  said Mr  Bush’s failure to get an apology from Mr  Trump for comments about Mr  Bush’s wife was telling  Mr  McInerney  an insurance agent  recalled a maxim of trial lawyers that you never ask a question without knowing how a witness will respond “He asked for a favor without knowing what the answer was going to be  and it got thrown back in his face ” Mr  McInerney said  “He didn’t corner him to the point where Donald Trump has no out ”At Iowa State University in Ames  four roommates who watched the debate agreed that Senator Marco Rubio was the winner  “He seemed not to focus on much of his past record but seemed to outline  This is my plan  this is what we should be doing ” said Evan Monson  a junior from Humboldt  Iowa Another competitor in Mr  Bush’s lane of establishment Republicans  Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey  also made strong impressions with Iowans Once a regular visitor to Iowa  Mr  Christie has recently dropped in polls there and has put most of his energy into New Hampshire  But he may want to consider calling his travel agent “I liked his chiding of Trump and Fiorina for being childish going back and forth ” Ms  Whisenand said Mr  Brown  an influential business figure in Des Moines  said he had never been more than lukewarm about Mr  Christie before the debate  but said he came across better than expected “I think he basically pushed open a crack in the door for people to listen to him more ” Mr  Brown said

President Joseph R  Biden Jr  looks like a man running for president  but he does not sound like it He flies around the country  making announcements  jogging in parades  giving speeches and enjoying the cheers  When he stops moving long enough to think  however  he makes abundantly clear that he does not have the fire for another campaign Other politicians express ambivalence before jumping into the presidential pool  but few if any voice the sort of doubts about their own capacity to undertake the ordeal as Mr  Biden has in recent days  In a call with Democrats  in a speech in Atlanta and on television Thursday night  he sounded like an unhappy warrior  still mourning his son  emotional  worn out  unsure of his future Rather than mounting a presidential campaign  Mr  Biden appears to be engaging in public therapy  working through grief in front of seemingly every camera in the nation  He saw Beau Biden  himself a budding politician who died in May at 46  as his legacy  With the younger Mr  Biden now gone  friends and advisers say the vice president is struggling with whether to run to honor Beau and create a new legacy “I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there ” he told Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” on CBS on Thursday  “I’m being completely honest  Nobody has a right  in my view  to seek that office unless they’re willing to give it 110 percent of who they are  As I said  I’m optimistic  I’m positive about where we’re going  but I find myself — you understand it — just sometimes it just sort of overwhelms you and I can’t be —— “Then he stopped In a halting voice  Mr  Biden described a recent encounter with a soldier  who called out Beau Biden’s name and said he had served with him in Iraq “All of a sudden  I lost it ” the vice president said He paused  “I shouldn’t be saying this ”He shook his head  “You can’t do that  You can’t do that ”Can’t do what  he did not say Many friends believe that he ultimately will not run  but they are trying to give him room to decide on his own  The lure is powerful for a man who has run for president twice before  Initially overlooked amid assumptions of a Hillary Rodham Clinton coronation  Mr  Biden now hears the siren song of Democrats calling out “Run  Joe  run ”Indeed  he has a greater groundswell of support now than in either of his campaigns in 1988 and 2008  Polls show him with a healthier base of support — 20 percent to Mrs  Clinton’s 37 percent in the latest CNN ORC survey — and advisers mapping out a path to the nomination imagine that the minute he announced  he would pick up 5 to 10 points  making it a legitimate contest  not a quixotic exercise But support also means he can opt not to run on his own terms — not because Mrs  Clinton eclipsed him but because it was the right decision for his family  In some ways  friends and advisers say  this most unusual exploration is about finding the respect he has not always felt in a White House he served loyally “He wants respect — he’s always craved it ” said one person who has worked with Mr  Biden and asked for anonymity to speak candidly  “He never wanted to be Uncle Joe who is irrelevant and comes to the parties and tells old stories ”Mr  Biden  who as a senator for 36 years had no boss  struggled at first to find his place working for Mr  Obama  who did not always appreciate his loquacious vice president’s gaffes  When Mr  Biden said in 2009 that the administration’s economic rescue efforts had a 30 percent chance of failure  Mr  Obama publicly laughed it off as another Uncle Joe moment At a subsequent lunch  Mr  Biden complained to Mr  Obama about being hung out to dry  Mr  Obama accepted the grievance and made a point afterward of not publicly making fun of his vice president  He had no time for those who suggested replacing Mr  Biden on the 2012 ticket But there were other moments of friction with the president’s staff  During the 2012 campaign  Mr  Biden’s advisers encouraged him to meet with party donors to maintain viability for a future presidential run  Mr  Obama’s campaign team  led by Jim Messina  took it badly  wondering if Mr  Biden was out for himself  Mr  Biden  in turn  bristled at anyone questioning his loyalty The tension blew up in May 2012 when Mr  Biden endorsed same sex marriage in a TV interview before the president did  Mr  Obama’s aides  like David Plouffe  his senior adviser  were angry that he had forced the president’s hand  and some suspected Mr  Biden was positioning himself for a future campaign Mr  Messina and much of the Obama campaign apparatus enlisted with Mrs  Clinton at the start of the second term without so much as a nod at Mr  Biden  The person who worked with Mr  Biden said the vice president and his wife  Jill  were “stung” when Mr  Obama gave a joint interview with Mrs  Clinton as she left the State Department in what looked like a passing of the baton  Still  Mr  Biden did not ask anyone to wait for him As some advisers point out  every vice president feels anxious about his treatment by the West Wing  By all accounts  Mr  Obama and Mr  Biden have forged a genuinely close relationship  one on display at Beau Biden’s funeral  “Joe  you are my brother ” Mr  Obama said with evident feeling  hugging Mr  Biden and kissing him on the cheek “My sense is that he and the president are very close  they’re close friends  and he’s regarded by a lot of us as maybe not the closest person to the president in government but among them ” said Senator Thomas R  Carper  a Democrat from Mr  Biden’s home state  Delaware Jared Bernstein  Mr  Biden’s former economics adviser  said the White House overcame any tension  “There were times where he leaned too far over his skis  and of course nobody liked that ” he said  “But in terms of the weight of his experience and his intuitive sense of how a lot of our stuff was playing with the middle class  I think he got a lot of respect ”The White House lately has made a point of showing that respect  Josh Earnest  the White House press secretary  said the president entrusted Mr  Biden with important issues like the stimulus package  gun control  Iraq and Ukraine  “Through it all  the vice president has been highly effective  which has earned him the respect and admiration of everyone who works in the West Wing  including  of course  the president ” Mr  Earnest said Inside Mr  Biden’s circle  some aides  like Mike Donilon  are enthusiastic about a campaign  arguing that the country needs him  Mr  Biden’s chief of staff  Steve Ricchetti  is described as trying to help him navigate the process in neutral fashion but devising a strategy in case he runs Some friends said Mr  Biden should  “I’ve known the man for 40 years — this is his destiny ” said Gary Hindes  who co hosted a dinner at the 21 Club in New York featuring Mr  Biden this week  “He’s conducted his entire political life  I think  with the fact that he very well one day would be president ”He added  “Now  maybe he doesn’t get in  But if I were him  I would not want to look back and think I should have taken the shot ”Others  like Ted Kaufman  Mr  Biden’s longtime friend  adviser and successor in the Senate  are said to be more dubious while trying to support his decision making process  Advisers describe Jill Biden as broken up about Beau’s death and unenthusiastic about a campaign  Mr  Biden himself is concerned about Beau’s widow and children Now he is in a position he never imagined  When he came to the White House in 2009  he told The New York Times  he considered the vice presidency “a worthy capstone in my career ” He resolved to pave the way for Beau Biden to continue the legacy  Then his son got cancer Friends say his emotional struggle has grown more difficult since Beau Biden’s death  not easier  He mentions Beau all the time  At 72  he is struggling to make peace with this period of his life  And the country is watching him do it ","headline":{"main":"As the Nation

In a forceful speech on Saturday to an influential gay rights group  Hillary Rodham Clinton reaffirmed her support for gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender Americans Hours later  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who is contemplating his own presidential run  stood before the same organization and praised Americans who have fought for gay rights “Love is not a political matter  it’s a basic human right ” Mr  Biden said to a gathering of members of the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday night  “The fact that we recognize that  it’s because of you ”Mr  Biden’s potential candidacy has loomed over Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  and the speeches on Saturday presented a rare occasion for these two former Senate colleagues and potential rivals to showcase their zeal and style on gay rights  one of the most galvanizing issues for Democratic primary voters and donors In her address  Mrs  Clinton focused on policies she would enact with a promise to make lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender issues central to her presidency  Mr  Biden said government had not been the driver of the rapid change in gay rights  and gave credit to the people in the crowd and the Americans across the country who came out about their sexuality  Both speeches drew roaring applause and enthusiasm from the crowd Mrs  Clinton  who addressed the organization on Saturday morning  emphasized transgender rights  which are seen as the next front in the gay rights movement in America  “Transgender people are valued  they are loved  they are us ” Mrs  Clinton said She vowed to do more to curb violence against transgender people  particularly African American women  and urged the military to reverse its policy and allow transgender Americans to serve in the armed forces  “Having the world’s strongest military  she said  “doesn’t just mean having the best trained forces or the biggest arsenal ”“It means ” she added  “being a leader on issues like this ”Mr  Biden called transgender rights “the civil rights issue of our time” and also expressed his support for allowing their service in the military   In an aside  he also called for increased gun control measures in light of the mass shooting in Oregon  The speeches allowed Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Biden to address an important constituency and powerful donor base of prominent  politically active lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people from across the country who will be critical in the 2016 presidential contest — a group that largely views both Democrats exceedingly favorably “I see the injustices and dangers that you and your family still face ” Mrs  Clinton said  “I am running for president to end them once and for all ”Mr  Biden did not offer any hints about his presidential ambitions  even amid the occasional chant of “run Joe  run ”   He echoed much of what Mrs  Clinton said in her speech  calling on Congress to pass the Federal Equality Act and urging more attention to human rights abuses against gay  lesbian and transgender people abroad The Human Rights Campaign  led by a former aide to President Bill Clinton from Arkansas  Chad Griffin  has deep ties to Mrs  Clinton and had invited her to deliver the keynote address at its gathering Saturday night  But Mrs  Clinton had a scheduling conflict — she was to appear on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” — so the group added a breakfast at which she could speak  The organization also honored Tim Cook  the chief executive of Apple  who recently came out as gay The group has started its endorsement process  with questionnaires sent to candidates  but it does not typically back a candidate until the general election In her address  Mrs  Clinton delivered a pointed attack on Republican presidential candidates who oppose same sex marriage and other equal protections  “You turn on the TV and you see a Republican candidate for president literally standing in the courthouse door in Kentucky ” she said  referring to Mike Huckabee’s support of Kim Davis  the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples Both Mr  Biden’s and Mrs  Clinton’s attacks on Republicans were delivered with some levity that played well in the crowds at their two appearances on Saturday  “Ted Cruz slammed a political opponent for marching in a pride parade ” Mrs  Clinton said  “He clearly has no idea what he’s missing ”Mr  Biden  in talking about how the vast majority of Americans support same sex marriage  appeared to deliver an off the cuff line  “There are homophobes still left  most of them are running for president  I think ” he said Some gay activists say Mrs  Clinton offered a relatively delayed and cautious embrace of same sex marriage  Mr  Biden’s surprising expression of support for same sex marriage in 2012 was widely seen as prodding President Obama to take the same position days later  which was not lost on the crowd on Saturday Of his 2012 comment on “Meet the Press” about same sex marriage  Mr  Biden said  “Folks  I was just answering in a straightforward  direct way  what I’ve known my whole life ” and told a story of learning tolerance as a teenager growing up in Delaware “I absolutely love Joe Biden ” said Brad DiFiore  a 46 year old who works in the aviation industry in Atlanta and was in town for the gathering He said that he had never been a supporter of Mrs  Clinton but that she impressed him with her remarks that morning  “She was more impressive in person and had such a natural ease in that environment ” he said Mrs  Clinton has in recent years rejected two policies from her husband’s administration that were seen as setting back the gay rights movement — a position she reiterated on Saturday “ ‘Don’t ask  don’t tell’ is over ” Mrs  Clinton said about the legislation enacted by her husband that prevented gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military  “But that doesn’t change the fact that more than 14 000 men and women were forced out of the military for being gay ”Both Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Biden expressed support for the Obama administration’s policy that reverses dishonorable discharges given to people because of their sexual orientation “I think she’s been very good on L G B T  issues  but always in the context of politics ” said Seth Kalish  48  a graphic designer  “It’s typical for someone wanting to get to the White House to be cautious ”Others blamed Mrs  Clinton’s husband for her mixed experiences on same sex issues  “That was Bill  and it was a different time ” said Ellen Griffith  54  a consultant who married her wife  Mary Ellen Garrity  last year “That was some unfortunate legislation ” Ms  Griffith said of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act and “don’t ask  don’t tell ” “But the important thing is that she admits it

That’s not      You can’t do that ” he said Mr  Colbert repeatedly seemed to try to prod Mr  Biden to run  saying at one point that the American people were inspired by the vice president because of the tragedies he had endured  In addition to the death of his son  Mr  Biden’s first wife and his daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972 Mr  Colbert  who lost his father and two brothers in an airplane crash  told Mr  Biden  “It’s going to be emotional for a lot of people if you don’t run  Your example of suffering and service is something that would be sorely missed in the race ”Mr  Biden seemed almost embarrassed by the praise  saying  “I feel self conscious  The loss is serious and it’s consequential  but there are so many other people going through this ”At Mr  Colbert’s urging  he also discussed religion and philosophy at length  describing his Roman Catholic faith as providing an “enormous sense of solace ” He attributed part of it to the rituals of his religion “I go to Mass  and I’m able to be just alone  even in a crowd ” Mr  Biden said  He recalled how his wife  Jill  once taped a note on his bathroom mirror with a quote from the philosopher Kierkegaard that said  “Faith sees best in the dark ”There was one moment when Mr  Biden seemed to suggest where he might find the strength to run  He noted that his mother had a favorite expression  “As long as you are alive  you have an obligation to strive  and you’re not dead until you see the face of God ”Mr  Biden said he did not want to let his family down by allowing the weight of the tragedies to keep him from continuing to strive “No one owes you anything ” Mr  Biden said  “You got to get up  And I feel like I was letting down Beau  letting down my parents  letting down my family ” Mr  Colbert interrupted  asking why they would be let down  “If I didn’t just get up ” Mr  Biden said “I marvel at the ability of people who absorb hurt and just get back up ” he said The interview had a few light moments  The vice president’s microphone malfunctioned at one point  prompting Mr  Biden to joke that “they do this to me at the White House all the time — shut my mike off ”The audience laughed at Mr  Biden’s retort when Mr  Colbert remarked that his mother had to take care of him when his father died “I imagine that would be a hell of a job ” the vice president said  making Mr  Colbert laugh as well Mr  Colbert started the show with a routine about the presidential candidates  including Donald J  Trump  Mr  Colbert noted that a recent Republican focus group included one man who supported Mr  Trump because the candidate wears a hat that says he would “Make America Great” again That led to photographs of Rick Perry  aa former governor of Texas  wearing a 10 gallon hat with the word “Oops” emblazoned on it  as well as a joke about Hillary Rodham Clinton  Mr  Colbert showed her wearing a plain white cap that “completely explains her email scandal  but unfortunately  she erased it ”","headline":{"main":"Joe Biden, in Colbert Interview, Expresses Doubts About Bid for President","print_headline":"Biden Shares With Colbert His Painful Inner Debate"},"wordCount":"899"},

increasingly worried about the threat of a challenge from Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   is making a sudden and urgent effort to throw roadblocks into his path After months of voicing doubt about a challenge from the vice president  Clinton campaign operatives are viewing Mr  Biden’s entry into the contest as a serious possibility and are trying to rally the party’s apparatus and its donors to her side  They have flooded uncommitted Democrats with emails  phone calls and a plea for them to sign a letter  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  In the letter  Democrats are asked to “pledge to support Hillary Rodham Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Committee Convention with my unpledged delegate vote ”A campaign aide said that given the mistakes of Mrs  Clinton’s 2008 campaign  they had always planned to make an early and aggressive push to lock down superdelegate support This Saturday  hours before Mr  Biden appears as the keynote speaker at the annual gala of the Human Rights Campaign  the most influential gay and lesbian political group in the country  Mrs  Clinton will have breakfast with the same group  And next Tuesday  former President Bill Clinton will appear on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert ” after an emotionally powerful appearance by Mr  Biden that became a viral video among some in the Democratic Party Mr  Biden has kept even his loyal supporters guessing about whether he will become a candidate  But the Clinton campaign is not taking chances  A subtle critique is emerging from the campaign’s allies about the potential vulnerabilities Mr  Biden would bring to the race This week  David Brock  who created the pro Clinton group Correct the Record  which is coordinating with Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  told Chicago Magazine his “gut” told him Mr  Biden would not run because “he’ll realize that at this point in his career  he can go out with everyone’s respect and esteem ”On a recent stop at a diner in Laconia  N H   Mrs  Clinton answered a voter’s question about why she had supported bankruptcy legislation that Senator Elizabeth Warren  Democrat of Massachusetts  and other liberal activists opposed  Unprompted  she raised the vice president’s role in the bill “I said  ‘It’s really important to me that we don’t hurt women and children  so I will support it even though there are other things I don’t like in it ’ ” Mrs  Clinton told the questioner  Jo Smith  Then she added  “It was Vice President Biden who was the senator from Delaware and the Republican co sponsor that I was talking with ”Aides to Mr  Biden did not comment  And Clinton aides  speaking on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing strategy in public  said that the effort to mobilize Democrats behind her was a natural progression of her candidacy  and unrelated to any potential challenger But several Democrats who have been in close contact with the campaign say they see a new sense of seriousness among her advisers about the prospect of a Biden candidacy  Mrs  Clinton’s team has been adamant that they are not behind efforts to draw negative attention to Mr  Biden  or to do anything to pressure him  Among the clearest signs in the last week was a series of phone calls from Mrs  Clinton and two of her top advisers  Huma Abedin and John Podesta  to the financier Robert Wolf  a major Democratic donor who is now supporting Mrs  Clinton but who recently met privately with Mr  Biden  In an email  Mr  Wolf confirmed recent discussions with Mrs  Clinton and her aides Mrs  Clinton raised roughly  28 million during the last three months  her campaign said on Wednesday — a sharp drop from the  47 5 million raised in the previous three months  partly because of the sluggish summer fund raising months and the possibility that Mr  Biden will enter the race Mr  Biden’s allies have made clear they are watching Mrs  Clinton’s poll numbers and the fallout over her use of a private email account at the State Department  And it has become increasingly clear that the activity by Mr  Biden’s associates to prepare for a potential campaign and to assess the amount of money and staff available to him has gained the attention of Mrs  Clinton’s operation The specter of Mr  Biden looms as a potential danger  but also as an incentive to motivate Mrs  Clinton and her operation   and to recover the fighting form she developed late in the 2008 presidential primary “I think they’re trying to create the impression that it will be difficult for anybody to climb up and beat Hillary in the superdelegate count ” said Ed Rendell  a former governor of Pennsylvania who is supporting Mrs  Clinton  But  he added  “I wouldn’t pressure people too hard if I were them ”Much of the Clinton campaign’s focus has been on the so called superdelegates  the elected officials and party elders who have significant influence in the nomination process  and whose endorsement carries weight with party insiders  Some superdelegates who have withheld their endorsement of Mrs  Clinton  in part because they are waiting to see if Mr  Biden will enter the race  have experienced heightened pressure from the Clinton campaign Should he decide to run  Mr  Biden and Mrs  Clinton would compete aggressively for the backing of African Americans  who have a hugely favorable opinion of Mrs  Clinton but who remain fiercely loyal to President Obama  and could see Mr  Biden’s candidacy as a continuation and affirmation of the first black president’s legacy Mrs  Clinton has made it a priority to reach out to African Americans throughout her campaign  with sweeping speeches on criminal justice reform and voting rights  James H  Hodges  a former governor of South Carolina who has endorsed Mrs  Clinton  said he liked and respected Mr  Biden — a line Clinton supporters often recite by heart — but concluded  “There is only one person who could beat Hillary Clinton in our state

Or would she  once in the White House  return to the finance friendly  deregulatory policies of the 1990s?Well  if Wall Street’s attitude and its political giving are any indication  financiers themselves believe that any Democrat  Mrs  Clinton very much included  would be serious about policing their industry’s excesses  And that’s why they’re doing all they can to elect a Republican To understand the politics of financial reform and regulation  we have to start by acknowledging that there was a time when Wall Street and Democrats got on just fine  Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs became Bill Clinton’s most influential economic official  big banks had plenty of political access  and the industry by and large got what it wanted  including repeal of Glass Steagall This cozy relationship was reflected in campaign contributions  with the securities industry splitting its donations more or less evenly between the parties  and hedge funds actually leaning Democratic But then came the financial crisis of 2008  and everything changed Many liberals feel that the Obama administration was far too lenient on the financial industry in the aftermath of the crisis  After all  runaway banks brought the economy to its knees  causing millions to lose their jobs  their homes  or both  What’s more  banks themselves were bailed out  at potentially large expense to taxpayers  although in the end the costs weren’t very large   Yet nobody went to jail  and the big banks weren’t broken up But the financiers didn’t feel grateful for getting off so lightly  On the contrary  they were and remain consumed with “Obama rage ”Partly this reflects hurt feelings  By any normal standard  President Obama has been remarkably restrained in his criticisms of Wall Street  But with great wealth comes great pettiness  These are men accustomed to obsequious deference  and they took even mild comments about bad behavior by some of their number as an unforgivable insult Furthermore  while the Dodd Frank financial regulation bill enacted in 2010 was much weaker than many reformers had wanted  it was far from toothless  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proved highly effective  and the “too big to fail” subsidy appears to have mostly gone away  That is  big financial institutions that would probably be bailed out in a future crisis no longer seem to be able to raise funds more cheaply than smaller players  perhaps because “systemically important” institutions are now subject to extra regulations  including the requirement that they set aside more capital While this is good news for taxpayers and the economy  financiers bitterly resent any constraints on their ability to gamble with other people’s money  and they are voting with their checkbooks  Financial tycoons loom large among the tiny group of wealthy families that is dominating campaign finance this election cycle — a group that overwhelmingly supports Republicans  Hedge funds used to give the majority of their contributions to Democrats  but since 2010 they have flipped almost totally to the G O P As I said  this lopsided giving is an indication that Wall Street insiders take Democratic pledges to crack down on bankers’ excesses seriously  And it also means that a victorious Democrat wouldn’t owe much to the financial industry If a Democrat does win  does it matter much which one it is? Probably not  Any Democrat is likely to retain the financial reforms of 2010  and seek to stiffen them where possible  But major new reforms will be blocked until and unless Democrats regain control of both houses of Congress  which isn’t likely to happen for a long time In other words  while there are some differences in financial policy between Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders  as a practical matter they’re trivial compared with the yawning gulf with Republicans ","headline":{"main":"Democrats, Republicans and Wall Street Tycoons","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"Waaaaah Street Attacks  "},"wordCount":"769"},

H  —  Hillary Rodham Clinton turned to New Hampshire Democratic officials and county leaders on Saturday for help in fighting the surging campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  who holds a steady lead over her in state opinion polls in the 2016 presidential primary race It was Mr  Sanders  speaking after Mrs  Clinton at the state party’s annual convention here  who received more ecstatic cheers from the crowd  as he denounced big banks  trade deals  tax breaks for the wealthy and “super PACs” like the one supporting Mrs  Clinton’s candidacy “Well  it certainly sounds like some people are ready for a political revolution ” Mr  Sanders said to shouts of “We love you  Bernie ”While Mrs  Clinton received an enthusiastic reception  with people beating inflatable noisemaker sticks that her well financed campaign passed out  the ovation for Mr  Sanders was striking because he is not a party member  he is a democratic socialist  and has far fewer endorsements than Mrs  Clinton from members of the state political apparatus  The convention drew about 1 000 delegates  many of them traditional politicians and elected officials not unlike Mrs  Clinton  and 3 000 other participants  many of them longtime avowed liberals like Mr  Sanders He acknowledged that he had come a long way since joining the race nearly four months ago  when he had a fraction of the support of Mrs  Clinton in the polls “What looked like a fringe campaign is now seen as a campaign that is standing up for working Americans  that is prepared to take on the billionaire class ” Mr  Sanders said  “I don’t want their money  I don’t want a super PAC  We’re going to do it on our own ”Mrs  Clinton  by contrast  highlighted recent endorsements from the state’s governor  Maggie Hassan  and Democratic senator  Jeanne Shaheen  and at various points mentioned her husband  former President Bill Clinton  a popular figure with Democrats here  Mr  Clinton  in his 1992 campaign  famously vowed to “be there for you ’till the last dog dies ” and Mrs  Clinton put her own spin on the sentiment “If you want a president who will listen to you  work her heart out to make your life better and together to build a stronger  fairer  better country  then you’re looking at her ” she said  drawing particular cheers from women as she emphasized the female pronoun She pledged to fight for equal pay for women and address income inequality  and again invoked her husband as an example of economic stewardship “When he got into the White House  he realized he had inherited real economic problems from his Republican predecessors — that seems to happen  have you noticed?” Mrs  Clinton said But she is not running on her husband’s coattails  she said  as she repeated a popular applause line from her stump speech  “I’m not running for my husband’s third term or President Obama’s third term  I’m running for my first term ” she said  in remarks that ran for about 40 minutes — twice as long as those of other candidates   One of them  Lawrence Lessig  a professor at Harvard Law School  gently chided her  noting that he would respect time limits for speakers  While the crowd applauded the attacks on Republican economic policies  some Democrats in the audience also displayed unhappiness with their own leaders  Scores of them heckled the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee  Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida  over the party’s decision to limit the number of debates for its presidential candidates to six — a decision that one candidate  former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  said was rigged to help Mrs  Clinton  At points they nearly drowned out Ms  Wasserman Schultz with “More debates ” and “We want debates ” and the chants grew so loud that she went off script and addressed them “What’s more important  driving the contrast with Republicans or arguing about debates?” Ms  Wasserman Schultz said  “Let’s focus on our task at hand ”She then tried to mollify the crowd by attacking a favorite target  the Republican candidate Donald J  Trump  for not correcting a man at a New Hampshire rally on Thursday who said Mr  Obama is a Muslim  The convention hall exploded in cheers  but the party unity did not last long  as the “More debates” catcalls resumed Still  Mr  Trump proved an easy source of applause that Democrats kept returning to “He’s been trafficking in prejudice and paranoia through this campaign ” Mrs  Clinton said  going on to give Democrats a retort to Mr  Trump’s campaign slogan  “When you hear Mr  Trump say  ‘Let’s make America great again ’ you respond  ‘America is great  We just need to make it work for all Americans ’ ”Mr  O’Malley drew one of his biggest ovations when he described Mr  Trump as “that racist  anti immigrant carnival barker” and blasted the Republican field for stoking the grievances of Americans “They can have their anger and their fear  but they cannot go unanswered ” Mr  O’Malley said  “Anger and fear never built a great country ”Mr  O’Malley  in his remarks  did not dwell on the issue of Democratic debates  but he made his case for more of them during a news conference afterward  He noted that the New Hampshire Democratic face off was scheduled for the Saturday before Christmas  one of the busiest shopping days of the year  when few voters might be inclined to watch the televised debate “I think everyone in the party realizes we should not let the Republican debates go unanswered ” Mr  O’Malley told reporters after his speech ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton and

C  —  After activists with Black Lives Matter disrupted his campaign appearances this summer  Senator Bernie Sanders  the surging if still long shot candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination  added a new section to his hour plus stump speech  explicitly addressing racial injustice But the true measure of the success of those remarks will not be just defusing anger but reaching out to African American voters  who are an essential bloc within the Democratic Party — especially in South Carolina  an early primary state  throughout which Mr  Sanders campaigned on Friday and Saturday Because black votes matter  too Meeting with about 50 pastors and community leaders  most of them black  at the Springfield Baptist Church in Greenville on Friday afternoon  he argued that income inequality was the moral issue of our time and that the people it hurt most were African Americans  He said that the criminal justice system should be reformed and that the killing of nine black people at Emanuel A M E  Church in Charleston — a massacre that had caused him to reschedule a planned campaign visit at the time — made it clear that the government needed to do more to break up hate groups  He made a similar stop on Saturday in Orangeburg But while Mr  Sanders went out of his way at both stops to reach out to black leaders  the thousands of people who came to hear him bellow  “We are going to end institutional racism ” as he did here on Saturday night  were overwhelmingly white And that poses a problem  If Mr  Sanders  who is climbing in polls and attracting the largest crowds of the campaign  hopes to broaden his support and be more than a footnote in the story of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s road to the Democratic nomination  he must demonstrate a capacity to draw support from African American voters  And that is likely to require a more targeted effort here in South Carolina South Carolina “could be up for grabs if Secretary Clinton is overconfident and thinks that the African American community will just support her  and especially if Senator Sanders continues to show his commitment and interest in the community ” Earl Simmons  a senior pastor at the Maple Creek Missionary Baptist Church in Greer  said after the private meeting in Greenville But Mr  Sanders gives essentially the same populist speech wherever he goes  whether his audience members are Iowan or South Carolinian  black or white Mr  Sanders said in an interview after an event in Sumter on Saturday that African Americans “should vote for me” because they would benefit from his war on income inequality and because of his civil rights record  Asked if he needed to hit issues of racial justice harder  Mr  Sanders referred testily to a passage on criminal justice reform in his hour and 15 minute stump speech  “What do you think I just spent 15 minutes talking about?”“Look  look  let’s be clear ” he added  turning his attention to Mrs  Clinton  “We’re running against a candidate whose husband was president of the United States who was very popular with the African American community — that’s a fact  And we’re running against a candidate who in 2008 spent an enormous amount of time running around this country  running for president against Obama  talking to all kinds of groups  And she is popular ”But Mr  Sanders said he was becoming better known  and “we will have more support in the African American community ”“I was pleased by the turnout here today” in Sumter  he continued  But the crowd was again predominantly white At one point  Mr  Sanders pitched the attractions of his home state of Vermont  which has a small African American population  by saying  “It has some good downhill ski areas ”Despite his status as the ascendant liberal alternative to Mrs  Clinton  and his history in radical leftist politics  it has been Mr  Sanders who has run into the most difficulty with the Black Lives Matter movement At a Netroots event in July  Black Lives Matter activists first attacked another Democratic challenger to Mrs  Clinton  Martin O’Malley  a former Maryland governor  for saying that “all lives matter ” But the activists  who prefer a racial justice based critique of American society to Mr  Sanders’s class based prism  gave Mr  Sanders an especially hard time “I’ve spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights ” he said at the time  adding that “if you don’t want me to be here  that’s O K ”It did not help him that the vigorous online defense of the candidate by his often white  male supporters  called the “bro gressives” by their detractors  resulted in the mocking hash tag  BernieSoBlack Then  this month  as he took the stage to celebrate Social Security at an appearance in Seattle  two Black Lives Matter activists commandeered the microphone  a move that left Mr  Sanders looking stunned and his wife shaking her head in disbelief That also happened to be the first day of work for Symone Sanders  the campaign’s national press secretary  who is African American  She had suggested to Mr  Sanders in her job interview — about a week after the Netroots debacle — that he say the names of black people who were apparently the victims of police brutality  and that “perhaps you should say” explicitly that racial and income inequality are linked In that West Coast campaign trip  she spent a lot of time onstage before Mr  Sanders’s appearances  defusing potential tensions  and Mr  Sanders started incorporating more of that message into his stump speeches He now talks about repairing the criminal justice system  bemoans the dragging of “unarmed African Americans” out of cars by the police and the stripping away of voting rights  and trumpets his legislation to remove corporations from the jailing business  It is a message he has taken around the country Mathany Ahmed  22  an African American who listened to Mr  Sanders in Iowa City  said she was encouraged that after the run in with Black Lives Matter  Mr  Sanders had “hired a black woman to join his campaign team and added the whole racial injustice platform because of that whole situation ”“It was justified ” she added  “and it worked ”But South Carolina is the testing ground for Mr  Sanders  And while he has been out front on many issues important to African Americans  he has a mixed record on guns  an issue of deep concern among voters here Asked whether that concerned him  Mr  Sanders said  “I think we’re doing fine  thanks ” and walked off to take a picture with volunteers He and his campaign are convinced he is headed in the right direction In Greenville  Symone Sanders introduced him by saying that “black lives are under attack” and that change is as necessary now “as it was in the Jim Crow era ” In Columbia  she welcomed Mr  Sanders to the stage by exalting “this multiracial revolution ”At both events  Mr  Sanders made sure to say  “Symone mentioned this ” when talking about efforts to suppress the vote of “people of color ” He said how the massacre in Charleston made it clear that racism remained “a much too real part of American life” and that the recent deaths of African Americans at the hand of police officers underlined the need for police forces that “reflect the diversity of the community they serve ”After the speech in Greenville  Rosemary Wallace  53  a supporter of Mr  Sanders who is African American  said she had driven an hour and a half to the event to “come out and represent  because there’s so few of us ”","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders Courts Black Voters in South

after months of political heartburn  things finally started cutting Hillary Rodham Clinton’s way Her performance at the first Democratic presidential debate was so commanding that even her greatest vulnerability — the lingering controversy over her private email practices as secretary of state — ended up redounding to her benefit After she crisply explained that she made a “mistake” using a private email server and defended her judgment  the moderator  Anderson Cooper of CNN  turned to her biggest threat in the primary campaign so far  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  in hopes that he would attack her  Mr  Sanders instead came to her aid “Let me say something that may not be great politics  but I think the secretary is right — and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails ” Mr  Sanders said to cheers and a standing ovation from the Democratic audience “Thank you ” Mrs  Clinton said  reaching out and shaking his hand  “Me  too  Me  too ”All night  the debate played to Mrs  Clinton’s advantage and to her opponents’ limitations  From gun control and banking regulations to debt free college and Social Security benefits  Mrs  Clinton positioned herself as a champion of liberals  young people  and the elderly — the very voters who make up the Sanders coalition — while also repeatedly reaching out to women  as an advocate for families and children  and as  potentially  the nation’s first female president  Mr  Sanders  whose plain spoken disgust over the email controversy drew praise  looked sheepish and reactive at other points  hesitating to attack Mrs  Clinton forcefully over her ties to Wall Street  and running into trouble defending his past opposition to stricter gun control laws and immigration reform By the end of Tuesday night’s debate  Mrs  Clinton had seized every opening to try to accomplish her chief goal  re establishing trust with Democrats who have come to doubt her honesty and political competence after months of difficulties and shifting policy positions Right from her opening remarks  Mrs  Clinton sounded a liberal rallying cry  saying “the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much” in taxes  She sought to create a bond with voters by saying she would judge free trade deals  which are broadly unpopular on the left  by whether she could “look into the eyes of any middle class American and say this will help raise your wages ”She called for increasing Social Security benefits for the poorest recipients and singled out older women who were “impoverished” because they had not earned enough money earlier in their lives And she was blunt in saying she has a liberal political philosophy but is also a pragmatic leader who would work with both Democrats and Republican to pass legislation “I’m a progressive  but I’m a progressive who likes to get things done ” she said  “I know how to find common ground  but I know how to stand my ground ”Mrs  Clinton was effective in cornering Mr  Sanders on the issue of gun control  Mr  Sanders  who is hugely popular among liberals  has opposed some gun control legislation like the Brady Bill — and Mrs  Clinton made sure that voters knew it After Mr  Sanders defended his record on gun laws  Mr  Cooper  the moderator  asked if Mr  Sanders was “tough enough” on guns “No  Not at all ” Mrs  Clinton said emphatically  She then listed Mr  Sanders’s history opposing gun control at length — well aware that every minute a Democratic debate was about gun control was a minute too long for Mr  Sanders The burdens on Mrs  Clinton were unusually heavy for the first debate of a presidential campaign  when candidates typically focus on introducing themselves to a national television audience and gently drawing distinctions with their rivals  Not so Mrs  Clinton  The continuing Republican attacks over her trustworthiness and judgment  particularly over her email have tarnished her in the eyes of many voters  Some are tired of endless Clinton melodramas  others tantalized by Mr  Sanders’s left wing candidacy Given Mrs  Clinton’s vulnerabilities — she lags behind Mr  Sanders in polls of New Hampshire primary voters — she needed to use the debate to persuade voters to look beyond her political troubles and see her as likable  rather than programmed  as genuinely liberal  as opposed to strategic  and ultimately as electable  instead of as a damaged candidate compared with  say  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who is considering entering the race Mrs  Clinton’s unspoken aim was to demonstrate such strength and spiritedness that Mr  Biden would see little point in challenging her for the Democratic nomination Indeed  her expertise as secretary of state translated into stature on the debate stage — a sophistication about global challenges and poise under fire  On dealing with President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia  Mrs  Clinton crisply described the ways that the United States’ relationship with Russia had soured since Mr  Putin returned to the presidency “We have to stand up to his bullying ” Mrs  Clinton said  “I think it’s important  too  that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it’s not acceptable for him to be in Syria  creating more chaos  bombing people in support of Assad ”Mrs  Clinton also put two rivals in their place when they challenged her judgment on foreign policy  Replying to former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  who questioned her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq  she scoffed at “a lot of loose talk going on here” and noted how “pleased” she had been when Mr  O’Malley endorsed her in 2008 And when another Democratic candidate  Lincoln Chafee  criticized Mrs  Clinton for “poor judgment calls” in authorizing the invasion of Iraq  Mrs  Clinton pivoted by noting that President Obama apparently had no problem with her judgment when he selected her as secretary of state The most vexing challenge for Mrs  Clinton was how to handle Mr  Sanders  He has consistently taken the high road whenever controversy has engulfed her  as he did in refraining from trying to score points over her email controversy Mrs  Clinton is skilled at parrying direct attacks  like those she faced in 2008 from her Democratic rivals over the Iraq war  health care  and driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants  With Mr  Sanders  she needed to find ways to undercut him without undercutting her own goals of appearing personable and appealing to his supporters to give her a second look Mrs  Clinton chose to challenge Mr  Sanders carefully on issues that are important to liberals  and more forcefully on gun control  She was the first to criticize another candidate  chiding Mr  Sanders over his distaste for the excesses of capitalism and his embrace of democratic socialism and political systems like the government of Denmark “We are not Denmark — I love Denmark — we are the United States of America ” Mrs  Clinton said  “We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history of the world ”Mr  Sanders pushed back at times  noting his support for small businesses and later his backing for some gun control laws  While he criticized some of her hawkish foreign policy stands  including support for a no fly zone in Syria  he had fewer memorable moments than Mrs  Clinton as he stuck to reiterating his long record of supporting campaign finance reform and fighting against climate change But for the most part  rather than compete against Mr  Sanders  she sought to reinforce her support for issues important to crucial Democratic primary constituencies  a criminal justice overhaul and gun control  a priority for black and Hispanic voters  and equal pay  female voters  In the end  Mrs  Clinton’s criticisms of Mr  Sanders appeared unlikely to dissuade his supporters  who include 650 000 donors — many of whom believe they are supporting a noble political cause against an establishment that Mrs  Clinton is the face of  His admirers like that he does not make typical political attacks — the sort that Mrs  Clinton made throughout the night  If she did not land any decisive blows against Mr  Sanders  she showed determination and skill in taking him on “Sanders has the momentum in key states right now  and he’s getting a free ride from the media and voters  and she can’t let that continue forever ” said Stuart Stevens  a Republican strategist who advised Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential race  “This debate is the first step toward Hillary stopping Bernie ”","headline":{"main":"Democratic Debate Turns Hillary Clinton’s Way After Months of Difficulties","content_kicker":"News Analysis","kicker":"News Analysis","print_headline":"After Months of

Bernie Sanders of Vermont gave another of the populist speeches that have drawn the largest crowds of the 2016 campaign to his rallies around the country and have made him the unexpected rival to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination The role of “super PACs” is “corrupt and amounts to legalized bribery ” he bellowed  Waving his arms  he quoted Abraham Lincoln and shared his own “vision for the future of this country ”On the campaign trail  the speech would have elicited wild enthusiasm from his liberal supporters  But this was the Senate  which was virtually empty except for Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  who was busy editing her own speech  and Senator Mike Lee  Republican of Utah  who was texting “You come here  it’s like  ‘O K   not much response ’ ” Mr  Sanders said with some resignation in his Senate office earlier this month  These days  Mr  Sanders  a professed socialist  does not feel rejected by his colleagues so much as baffled by a clubby institution that does not seem to understand the deep resentment about economic inequality that his campaign has tapped  “When I’m outside of here ” he said  “the ideas and the points that we are making are reverberating very strongly with the American people ”For all his newfound attention  Mr  Sanders is still regarded by his Senate colleagues as a peripheral figure whose surging presidential campaign is more of an endearing curio than a cause for reassessment Senators “are kind of surprised at the phenomenon ” said Vermont’s senior senator  Patrick J  Leahy  who  like many other Democrats  is backing Mrs  Clinton  “But nobody is trash talking Bernie ”That is because many senators respect Mr  Sanders’s consistency and fealty to his principles  his policy fluency and his ability to work with Republicans when he was chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs to pass legislation that overhauled the veterans’ health care system Others  however  consider such legislation a notable exception for a compromise allergic ideologue who has over time managed to infuriate some moderate Democratic lawmakers resentful of his self assigned role as the Senate’s liberal conscience Mr  Sanders is also not much of a favorite of Capitol Hill reporters who have grown used to his grumbling expressions of displeasure at the political nature of their questions  Asked about a gleaming “Excalibur” hanging on a wall in his office  Mr  Sanders made it clear he knows his reputation “That is from Ross Perot ” Mr  Sanders said  “He said  ‘When media gives you a problem  take it out  Threaten them ’ ”  It was actually a gift for his work on the veterans bill  Mr  Sanders’s disdain for the things he views as unimportant is matched by his single minded focus on the things he says are of real consequence  like the future of Social Security At the Democratic caucus lunches  at which he is a fixture  “all he ever talks about is Social Security ” one congressional aide said  “He doesn’t even try to relate it to the topic at hand ”That focus was on display a few weeks ago when  on an especially slow day in the Senate with only a minor vote on the schedule  caucus members piled onto buses for a White House meeting with President Obama  Looking around the room  Mr  Obama was surprised to see Mr  Sanders “Bernie?” he said  “Shouldn’t you be out in New Hampshire?” There was a chuckle  and then the president asked Mr  Sanders what was on his mind “Social Security ” Mr  Sanders said While Mr  Sanders takes pride in his record of providing for his home state  Mr  Leahy made it clear that when it comes to bringing money back home to Vermont  “I’m usually the one who does that ”Mr  Sanders “is more interested in the larger macroeconomic issues ” said Eric L  Davis  a political science professor at Middlebury College in Vermont Asked about his legislative accomplishments over a congressional career that includes 14 years in the House and eight in the Senate  Mr  Sanders cited some amendments that passed the House  and several more recent highlights  One was getting billions of dollars of investment in energy efficient technologies as part of the stimulus bill  Another was inserting  11 billion for community health centers in the Affordable Care Act and tripling funding for the National Health Service Corps  which forgives debts for medical students who commit to working in underserved fields and communities He acknowledged that he has gotten little attention for what he has done  “This is the problem ” he said  “I work in areas that nobody knows what I’m doing ”The way he sees it  his career has not been that of a gadfly on the margins of Congress  but rather that of a moral force pulling the mainstream toward his positions “Stay with me on this one because this is important ” Mr  Sanders said as he sat in an armchair under Excalibur  Passing legislation is “real ” he said  but so is influencing opinion over the long term by speaking out early and often “I am a voice ” he said  “Everybody talks about income inequality  Well  check it out  Find out who was talking about it 20 years ago ”With the aid of a yellow legal pad on his lap  he went through a litany of instances in which his opposition to an issue now positions him in the Democratic mainstream He voted against the Defense of Marriage Act  “President Clinton signed it  everyone was for it”   the deregulation of Wall Street  “Check the record  Do it  Go to YouTube  look up ‘Bernie Sanders  Alan Greenspan’ ”   the war in Iraq  the Patriot Act and welfare reform  On all the issues  he suggested  he has moved the party But Mr  Sanders has been more of an outlier than a leader throughout his congressional career  When he was a congressman  elected as an independent  and House Democrats decided to allow him to caucus with them to increase their depleted numbers  Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico called him “a homeless waif” and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts bemoaned his “holier than thou attitude ”Since his election to the Senate in 2006  Mr  Sanders has become more reliable in his alignment with the Democrats   though he was a determined  and effective  opponent to Mr  Obama’s effort to reach a grand bargain on the budget in 2011 because of the possibility of cutting Social Security Tom Coburn  the former Republican senator from Oklahoma  who was also a part of those budget negotiations as a member of the bipartisan Gang of Six  said that Mr  Sanders had a “my way or the highway” approach to legislating  He recalled the time he held up one of Mr  Sanders’s bills in the Senate “He said  ‘If you’re going to hold my bill  I’m not going to negotiate with you ’ And I said  ‘That’s fine  I’m holding your bill then  If you want to adjust your bill and meet some of our concerns  then I’ll be happy to work with you ’ ” Mr  Coburn said  “But he never once did want to do that ”When Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  a moderate Democratic member of the Gang of Six working for the budget deal  was asked if Mr  Sanders understood the give and take of legislating  he smiled and said  “You always know where he stands ” before disappearing into an elevator Democrats often left their weekly caucus lunch fuming over Mr  Sanders’s latest immovable stance “I know there are other people who are kind of resentful of that  who sit down with Republicans and make a whole lot of concessions before the debate begins ” Mr  Sanders said  “That’s not my style ”Mr  Sanders is now the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee  and as such would generally be expected to lead the tense and consequential budget negotiations this fall But according to congressional aides familiar with the Senate Democratic leadership’s thinking  they have no intention of letting someone so averse to compromise lead the talks Mr  Sanders disagrees  He pointed to the compromise he struck on the veterans bill in June 2014 with Senator John McCain  Republican of Arizona Mr  McCain compared the negotiations to an invective strewn World Wrestling Federation match  but added  “I didn’t resent that at all  I respected it as a matter of fact because he had strongly held views ”A year later  as a presidential candidate  Mr  Sanders has shown an ability to use the Senate as another platform for his campaign  On June 14  as senators gushed over Mrs  Clinton when she addressed the Democrats’ caucus lunch in the Capitol  he slipped out early to take advantage of the television cameras outside  And he regularly introduces legislation  and gives emphatic floor speeches  echoing his campaign message “He was very enthusiastic for someone speaking to an empty room ” Janet Crnich  44  of Wisconsin  said approvingly after watching Mr  Sanders rail against the influence of money in politics from the Senate’s viewing gallery last week Asked in his office — a space decorated with books  “Wage Theft in America”   framed roll calls and pictures of him and President Bill Clinton — if he was a better politician than colleagues gave him credit for  Mr  Sanders put his finger to his lips “Shh ” he said with a smile  “Don’t give it away  You are going to ruin it for me ”","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders, an Outlier?

Senator Bernie Sanders said that gun control was a matter best left resolved in state capitals In the aftermath of the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut  Mr  Sanders voiced support for new gun control measures  but also noted that the rights of law abiding gun owners “must be protected ”In fact  Mr  Sanders sounded downright skeptical of the push for tighter new laws “If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow  I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen ” he told Seven Days  an alternative weekly in Vermont Mr  Sanders’s statements on gun control  while less forceful than those of some other Democrats  did not seem out of place for a senator from a state where hunting is prevalent But with last week’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon stirring debate about America’s gun laws  Mr  Sanders’s attitudes toward gun control and the Second Amendment are facing fresh scrutiny as his presidential bid gains steam While Mr  Sanders has outflanked Hillary Rodham Clinton by appealing to liberals  his record on gun related issues could be a potential vulnerability in a Democratic contest in which he is not accustomed to facing doubts about his liberal credentials Campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday  another Democratic rival  former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  called on Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders to support a series of proposals he had laid out to address gun violence And on Monday  Mrs  Clinton detailed a gun  control plan  a mix of legislative and executive action that included an expansion of background checks  “How much longer will we just shrug?” Mrs  Clinton asked at a town hall gathering in New Hampshire For Mrs  Clinton  the issue is an opportunity to present herself as the most proactive Democratic candidate on gun control  and provide a contrast with Mr  Sanders  who has been gaining on her in national polls Mr  Sanders  for his part  is trying to balance representing a state where guns are mainly used for recreation against the need to appeal to a Democratic electorate increasingly agitated over mass shootings and demanding stricter gun control laws As he focuses his message on economic inequality  Mr  Sanders has seemed less than eager to discuss the issue of gun control  At a rally on Saturday in Boston  he waited until an hour into his speech to allude to the Oregon massacre Mr  Sanders voted against the Brady Bill in the 1990s  requiring background checks  when he was in the House of Representatives  And in 2005  he voted in favor of a bill to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits   Mrs  Clinton  then a senator from New York  voted against that bill  and is pledging to repeal it as part of her gun control plan  After the Newtown  Conn   shootings  Mr  Sanders  by then a senator  voted for expanding background checks and banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines His positioning has not endeared him to those on either side of the issue  When he last ran for re election in 2012  the National Rifle Association gave him a D minus rating  This summer  a “super PAC” supporting Mr  O’Malley released an ad that concluded  “Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns ”“I think it’s a little bit unfair to call him pro gun ” said Bertram Johnson  the chairman of the political science department at Middlebury College in Vermont  “I think it would be fairer to say he’s more in line with what the state thinks about this ”Mr  Sanders’s campaign manager  Jeff Weaver  defended the senator’s record on Monday  saying he has supported banning assault weapons and requiring background checks since he was first elected to Congress in 1990  Mr  Weaver added that Mr  Sanders opposed the Brady Bill because of the waiting period it imposed After the Oregon shootings  Mr  Sanders issued a statement calling for a “comprehensive approach” to deter mass killings  including “sensible gun control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them ”In an interview on MSNBC  he took a pragmatic approach  He said the nation needed to “get beyond the shouting” on the issue of guns and added  “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is ”“You can sit there and say  well  I think we should do this and do that ” he said  “But you got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all  And if we are going to have some success  we are going to have to start talking to each other ”In a statement on Monday  Mr  Sanders said his campaign was assembling a package of proposals to address gun violence  He expressed support for closing the so called gun show loophole and for banning assault weapons  among other things Mr  Sanders has also tried to draw attention to the different role of guns in his state compared with more densely populated areas  where guns are often associated with violence  not recreation  “The people of my state understand  I think  pretty clearly  that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or guns in Los Angeles ” he said in July on CNN Vermont has a high level of gun ownership compared with other states in the Northeast  It also has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country  At the same time  Vermont has few murders committed with firearms “It’s a different life situation up here  and I think Senator Sanders has tried to explain that ” said Evan Hughes  a vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs  “His voting record has reflected the Vermont reality ”Ann Braden  the president of Gun Sense Vermont  a group that formed after the Newtown shootings and advocates new gun laws  said Mr  Sanders’s focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands — but not attacking the mere idea of gun ownership — was “how you can actually make change ”“There are many  many responsible gun owners ” she said  “and it’s important to have someone who understands that ”","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders, a Hunting-State Senator, Treads Lightly With Guns","print_headline":"A Hunting-State Senator Treads Lightly With

candidates disagree with President Obama on trade  They think he has not done enough to push for gun control or to overhaul the immigration system  They believe they could do a better job moving legislation through a Republican controlled Congress And on Tuesday night in Las Vegas at the first Democratic primary debate  a new reality will become clear  It’s not Barack Obama’s party anymore In the seven years since Mr  Obama entered the White House on a wave of excitement  Democrats have developed a complicated relationship with their standard bearer  And that is especially true for those running for their party’s nomination Mr  Obama’s legacy and how much a Democratic successor should embrace it will hover over the debate  even as Hillary Rodham Clinton  Senator Bernie Sanders and the other Democratic candidates put forth their specific policy proposals and promises “It is an existential moment ” said Jon Cowan  a former Bill Clinton administration official who is now president of the centrist think tank Third Way  “If you stand back far enough entering this debate ” he added  “you’ll see the Democratic Party they’re asking to lead  and there’s no question it has moved to the left ”Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders promise different approaches from Mr  Obama’s  as much in style as in substance Both have suggested they could get more accomplished  though Mrs  Clinton does so in more oblique terms  In a podcast interview with the former Obama strategist David Axelrod  Mr  Sanders implied that the president had been naïve to think Republicans would sit down with him  “I think it took the president too long to fully appreciate that ” the Vermont senator said Last week  Mrs  Clinton told Telemundo that Mr  Obama’s mass deportations were “part of a strategy” to get congressional Republicans on board with a comprehensive immigration overhaul and that the “strategy is no longer workable ”A theme likely to dominate the debate  on CNN  is the problem of economic inequality and with it the implicit critique that although Mr  Obama pulled the economy out of the crisis that enveloped it in 2008  the recovery has left the vast majority of Americans behind  That sentiment has manifested itself on the campaign trail in a populist conviction reflected in the major candidates’ positions on topics including trade agreements and Wall Street regulation “They may not come out and criticize Obama  but they’ll all be saying  ‘This hasn’t been a good recovery for most people ’ ” said Dean Baker  an economist and a co director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Mrs  Clinton reflects the party’s tack to the left on domestic issues Last week  she said she could not support Mr  Obama’s signature trade pact  the Trans Pacific Partnership  which she had championed as secretary of state and which Mr  Sanders had come out forcefully against  She has also proposed doing away with the so called Cadillac tax on certain health care plans  aligning herself with labor unions on dismantling a key part of Mr  Obama’s Affordable Care Act  Mr  Sanders has also taken aim at the law  saying it does not go far enough to make health insurance affordable for many Americans After much criticism from party liberals that the Obama administration did not do enough to punish the Wall Street executives responsible for the financial crisis  Mrs  Clinton on Thursday included in her proposal to regulate Wall Street this clear message  “When people commit crimes on Wall Street  they will be prosecuted and imprisoned ”That stood out as a break with the White House  which “basically took a pass when it came to prosecuting anyone from the financial crises ” Mr  Baker said While the emphasis on economic populism can be attributed partly to the nature of a Democratic primary contest  during which candidates try to woo labor unions and the liberal activist base  polls show that there is a broader frustration among voters about income inequality  Sixty one percent of Americans said they believed only a few people at the top had a chance to get ahead in today’s economy  and 66 percent said income and wealth in the United States should be more evenly distributed  according to a New York Times CBS News poll from June “The American public is anxious and angry and ready for very deep reform across kitchen table issues ” said Felicia Wong  the president and chief executive of the Roosevelt Institute  a liberal think tank  “And that’s really what’s going on in the electorate right now ”Last week  Mr  Obama hosted a White House summit meeting on how to lift middle class wages  and at a fund raiser in Los Angeles on Saturday  he said one of the problems that had not been fully solved during his administration was “the fact that wages and incomes for ordinary Americans are still flat ”But aides point to his plan on college affordability and his efforts to raise the minimum wage  expand overtime pay  and make child care more affordable and accessible “In terms of helping middle class families meet their biggest budgetary stresses  I think Obama has been there ” said Jared Bernstein  a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr “He hasn’t gone as far in that space as what the candidates are proposing ” Mr  Bernstein added  “but he’s gone part of the way ”Josh Earnest  the White House press secretary  said in a briefing last week that Mr  Obama “understands that it is the responsibility of individual candidates to distinguish themselves ”“That means distinguishing themselves from their competitors ” Mr  Earnest continued  “And in some cases  that means distinguishing themselves from the current occupant of the office ”But if the substance of Mr  Obama’s policies will be indirectly debated on Tuesday  so will his style and the criticism that he has not tried hard enough to work with his political opponents Without mentioning the president  Mrs  Clinton often promotes her ability to work with congressional Republicans  a theme she is likely to lean on heavily in the Tuesday debate  “We’ve got a pretty dysfunctional mess in Washington ” Mrs  Clinton said at a recent rally in Columbus  Ohio “But I worked across the aisle as a senator for eight years ” she added  “I worked with Republicans as secretary of state  I know there is no substitute for working hard every single day to find common ground ”William A  Galston  a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to Bill Clinton  said the candidates would face added pressure to explain precisely how they would move past the bipartisan dysfunction that defined the current administration “We’ve had two presidents over a period of nearly 16 years who have failed on what was arguably the central promise of both their campaigns ” Mr  Galston said  referring to Mr  Obama and George W  Bush  “To bring a divided country back together ”Still  Mr  Obama is more broadly popular than Mr  Bush was in the fall of 2007  when the country began to take the measure of those who would succeed him That makes too pointed a repudiation of Mr  Obama’s leadership risky for the Democratic candidates  The president  whose approval rating nationally is roughly 47 percent  enjoys loyal support from key constituencies  African Americans  who make up a central bloc in Mrs  Clinton’s support  and college educated white liberals  an important group for Mr  Sanders On Sunday  Mr  Obama defended his legacy in an interview with CBS News’s “60 Minutes” saying he was “very proud of what we’ve accomplished  and it makes me think I’d love to do some more ” When asked whether he would be elected for a third term if allowed to run  Mr  Obama answered with an unequivocal “yes ”","headline":{"main":"A Likely Debate Highlight: Democrats’ Distance From Obama","print_headline":"Obama Legacy Part of Debate for Democrats"},"wordCount":"1287"},

overtaken the Republican presidential race  embodied in the candidacy of Donald J  Trump  But it is also coursing through the Democratic electorate  fueling the popularity of Bernie Sanders  inspiring liberal challenges to party backed congressional candidates and spurring activism on causes from the minimum wage to the Keystone XL oil pipeline Nowhere was the discontent on the left — which has made targets out of banks  billionaires and backers of the status quo — more evident than in the stunning news last week that Mr  Sanders  who calls himself a democratic socialist  was raising money nearly as fast as Hillary Rodham Clinton Interviews with three dozen Democrats in key early states — a mix of undecided voters and Sanders and Clinton supporters — laid bare a sense of hopelessness that their leaders had answers to problems like income inequality and gun violence  It is frustration that Mr  Sanders  a senator from Vermont  and other progressive candidates are channeling and that Mrs  Clinton has addressed with increasing passion  as when she responded to Thursday’s massacre at an Oregon college by saying she was “just sick of this ”While alienation among Republicans has drawn more attention  given the fiery language of the race’s front running celebrity  Mr  Trump  the anti establishment mood on the left is just as intense and potentially just as consequential to the selection of a Democratic nominee Mrs  Clinton has tried to lift her declining poll numbers by highlighting endorsements from governors and lawmakers — but such establishment backing has yet to do much good  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  could face the same anti establishment headwinds if he enters the race  given his four decades in Washington  although allies believe he has the personal touch to win over angry Democrats  Mr  Sanders castigates “the entire political and economic establishment” regularly  by contrast  a message that has drawn 650 000 donors and huge crowds of fervent supporters  like the 20 000 people at his Boston rally on Saturday evening “I volunteered for Hillary when she ran for president in 2008  but her time is past  I think ” said Nikky Raney  25  a Democrat from Dover  N H  “And it’s Bernie who seems most genuine about universal health care and getting big money out of politics ”Though Mrs  Clinton remains popular in the party  especially among those who want to see a first female president  Mr  Sanders’s call for a “political revolution” and his consistently left wing policy ideas are inspiring to younger voters  seniors and liberals who would prefer to see a true believer overcome an establishment goliath “Income inequality has been growing for so many years that a lot of young people feel their Democratic leaders aren’t fighting hard enough on the issue ” said Brandon Lemay  the president of the Plymouth State University Democrats  after attending a speech by Mrs  Clinton near the campus in central New Hampshire Mr  Lemay said he was undecided between her and Mr  Sanders  “Hillary has definitely been refining her message to sound more liberal ” he said  “but Bernie’s convictions are just very strong  very intense ”Impatience with politics as usual has also led liberals to enter Democratic Senate primaries and mount more aggressive and well financed challenges than in years past to candidates backed by the national party establishment In Florida  Representative Alan Grayson  a self styled “progressive champion ” is portraying Representative Patrick Murphy  the Democratic Party’s preferred candidate for the seat being vacated by Senator Marco Rubio  as a “lightweight  empty suit errand boy for Wall Street ” A former president of the Chicago Urban League  Andrea Zopp  is running in Illinois against the party backed Representative Tammy Duckworth  And former Representative Joe Sestak is running as a liberal anti establishment candidate in Pennsylvania “Democrats are experiencing a taste of what Republicans experienced in 2010  when so called Tea Party candidates ran against establishment favorites ” said Jennifer Duffy  who tracks Senate races for the Cook Political Report  “More progressive or anti establishment candidates are jumping into Senate primaries  often at the urging of more progressive voters who are tired of the status quo and want candidates who will run on issues like income equity ”The contested primaries extend to House races  In New Jersey  a 24 year old Sanders supporter  Alex Law  is challenging Representative Donald Norcross  portraying him as a machine politician “Democrats have enjoyed watching Republicans fight among themselves for the last five years  but there are anti establishment and ideological divisions in the Democratic Party that will grow larger in the years to come ” said Nathan L  Gonzales  editor of The Rothenberg   Gonzales Political Report The disaffection among Democrats flows mainly from three sources  according to interviews with voters and strategists  Disappointment lingers with President Obama over the failure to break up big banks after the Great Recession and fight for single payer health insurance  among other liberal causes  Fatigue with Mrs  Clinton’s controversies endures  as does distaste with her connections to the rich  And anger abounds at party leaders for not pursuing an ideologically pure  economically populist agenda “Establishment Democrats like Hillary could end up heavily outspending people like Sanders  but it may not matter as much as usual because voters are searching for someone off the beaten path ” said Paul Maslin  who was the pollster for Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential race Tom Henderson  the Democratic chairman in Polk County  Iowa  which includes Des Moines  said the most widely shared frustration among Democrats there was “the manner in which the economy has bounced back” under Mr  Obama  Wall Street returns look strong and unemployment has declined  but wages and benefits are largely unchanged “I think Sanders is pulling in voters who aren’t typical rank and file Democrats  but rather folks who have become energized over the last few years to change the country’s direction ” said Mr  Henderson  who is currently neutral in the race  “The question for Sanders is whether he can get those people to show up and vote in February ”Across the country  discontent on the left is bubbling up in scattered ways Liberal activists in Iowa and elsewhere have pushed local Democratic officials to enact minimum wage ordinances in the face of inaction from state and federal government officials in both parties  Environmentalists put enormous pressure on Mrs  Clinton to come out against the Keystone pipeline project  which she did last month  Many progressives in New York City complain that the Democratic mayor  Bill de Blasio  appears to have lost his appetite for a criminal justice overhaul And last week  about 80 Democrats in New Hampshire banded together to demand that the Democratic National Committee allow candidates to participate in more debates than the six that the party has sanctioned  Many activists see the limit as rigging the debates in favor of Mrs  Clinton  whose advisers wanted as few as possible “There’s a level of anger among Democrats that the establishment has decided not to address  whether it’s about debates or other issues ” said Peter Burling  a former New Hampshire state senator who is supporting former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland in the presidential primary If Mr  Sanders proves too liberal to capture the nomination  allies of Mr  Biden believe the vice president is positioned to seize on anger at the establishment if he enters the race — even though his long tenure epitomizes it  These supporters say the freely emotional Mr  Biden is more capable of soothing Democratic anxieties than Mr  Sanders  a flinty Vermonter  or Mrs  Clinton  whose attempts to appear more likable and funny can come across as overly calculated Still  Mr  Biden has not decided on a run  and “Draft Biden” efforts have not yet caught on anywhere near the way Mr  Sanders has “There’s just so much hopelessness about people having any real opportunity to just make a living  take care of their families  support themselves ” said Karen Bryant  a physician from New Boston  N H  “Mrs  Clinton is floundering and Republicans like Jeb Bush are floundering because people see them as politicians whose messages change depending on who they are talking to or how much money they need to raise  If you live year after year not seeing politicians keep their promises  it leads you to support someone like Bernie Sanders ”","headline":{"main":"Democrats Find That Anti-Establishment Isn’t Just a G.O.P.

afternoon  Sabrina Dabakarov stood under the colonnaded portico of her family’s brick home on Midland Parkway in Queens and gestured at a neighborhood lined with oak trees and stately houses that for a century has played home to doctors  politicians and political bosses on 500 acres of hilly  meandering streets “This is supposed to be the melting pot — it’s Queens ” she said  “But when you are living in Jamaica Estates  it’s more secluded  There are kids I know who are 16 who can’t go down the block to the subway  It depends on what you are exposed to ”This is the house and neighborhood that Donald J  Trump grew up in more than a half century ago  A wealthy enclave built in part by his father  Jamaica Estates  with its cloistered atmosphere  nurtured the development of one of the city’s great developers  who is now the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination Mr  Trump may live in a gilded Trump Tower triplex in Manhattan  but it is his Queens childhood that provided him with old neighborhood authenticity and the us versus them combativeness that the Republican base has eaten up  While his detractors charge that his language on the campaign trail is infected with an Archie Bunker era nativism  Mr  Trump points in his defense to his formative years in one of the most diverse counties in the country But the Jamaica Estates of Mr  Trump’s boyhood was an exclusive and nearly all white place  resistant to outsiders and largely impenetrable to minorities “Different parts of Queens were rough  this was an oasis ” Mr  Trump said in an interview  He said Jamaica Estates “was safe — it was very family oriented ” He recalled taking the F train down the block into the city and called the area a “microcosm” that gave him perspective on New York and “what it was all about ”But some residents of his old neighborhood  and the more diverse areas that surround it  say they do not think he understands what the city  and the country  are all about  Hispanics  Trinidadians  Haitians and South Asians who walked this month in front of fried chicken joints  halal butchers and roti shops on Hillside Avenue  down the road from Mr  Trump’s old house  expressed disgust with his blunt vision of an America besieged by “rapist“ immigrants who are in the country illegally and black activists who he has said are “looking for trouble ”They considered him a camera hungry candidate who is capitalizing on the fear among white voters that the America they grew up in is fading “Old age is starting to creep up ” Melvin Hanna  a 57 year old African American man who lives in an apartment building down the street  said about Mr  Trump’s assertion that immigrants who were in the country illegally were now infiltrating gangs in predominantly black cities  But Mr  Hanna said he worried that the high level of support for Mr  Trump  who explicitly appeals to what he calls the “silent majority“ of Americans  showed that “some of what he is saying is what people are saying behind closed doors ”Not all of that talk remained behind closed doors during a recent visit to Jamaica Estates “I think he’s spot on ” said Fred Quint  52  Mr  Trump’s former next door neighbor  He recalled watching Mr  Trump’s father  Fred  leave for work every day in his chauffeured blue Cadillac limousine and seeing Donald return home for visits in a red convertible with his first wife  Ivana Mr  Quint explained that “racially speaking ” he and Mr  Trump “grew up in white America ” Today  he added  “it’s a much more racially mixed neighborhood  much more diverse ” with people who are Hindu  Muslim and Chinese “It’s the way of the world  white America is a thing of the past ” he said with a shrug  “The white man’s gone ”Mr  Trump acknowledged that the neighborhood around his 23 room  nine bathroom mansion had changed “The world is much different  turn on the television ” he said  adding  “That’s called life in New York  and I think that’s a wonderful thing ”And in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday  Mr  Trump answered questions about his failure to correct a supporter who asserted that Muslims were “a problem in this country” and that President Obama was one by saying  “I have friends that are Muslims  They’re great people  amazing people ”He would probably not have met them in the Jamaica Estates of his youth A 1910 brochure assured prospective buyers looking for a refuge amid the acres of elm and chestnut trees that “Jamaica Estates is the same distance from Herald Square that Columbia University is from City Hall ” Successive developers fought to keep building restrictions in the neighborhood in place and housing prices high The Trump family home was built by its patriarch  Fred C  Trump  who died in 1999  Mr  Trump called his father the person “I learned more from than anyone else ”Fred Trump was born in 1905 to struggling German immigrants and raised in the working class neighborhood of Woodhaven  Queens  where a plaque honors him as “father of ‘The Donald ’ “Fred’s father  an innkeeper who quenched the assorted appetites of Klondike gold rush miners before becoming a struggling New York developer  succumbed to pneumonia when his son was 13  At the onset of the Roaring Twenties  Fred started his own construction business  forming E  Trump   Son with his mother  Elizabeth  because he needed a partner old enough to sign the checks They found success building garages for newly popular cars and moved to Jamaica Estates  where he eventually built suburban style Tudors and Victorian and colonial style homes for the upper middle class After the Great Depression  he pretended to be Swedish so as not to drive off Jewish tenants  as he made his fortune building solid  low cost housing  Along the way  he married Mary MacLeod  a Scottish immigrant  and together they had f ive children  including Donald in 1946 The Trumps lived in a two story mock Tudor home on Wareham Place  where on a recent afternoon Jose Rivas  43  mowed grass on a small front lawn and shook his head at what he considered Mr  Trump’s anti immigrant language “Many  many Spanish people come here and work and pay taxes ” he said  looking around and admiring the homes  “I like it here  It’s beautiful ”In 1950  the city opened the 179th Street subway station on the corner of Hillside Avenue and Midland Parkway   “It’s the last stop on the F line  a neighborhood so outer borough it might as well be in another state ” New York magazine once sneered   The new station was just down the road from where Fred Trump built the family homestead the next year Even as a child  Donald loved to build things  “I always loved playing with blocks  anything having to do with blocks ” Mr  Trump said In the mornings  his father left for work in one of his two Cadillacs  license plates FT1 and FT2  and the Trump children often went next door to play with Heather Macintosh “The Macintoshes  nice people ” Mr  Trump said Edmund Hayes  Heather’s eventual husband  said his wife told him that the Trump children “never got a hug or a kiss” in their strict home  and that Donald was hypercompetitive  “She really didn’t like him ” he said of his wife Young Donald treated his home as a fortress  Laura Manuelidis  who lived behind Mr  Trump on Wareham Place  recalled that when a ball bounced into the Trumps’ grassy yard  he would not throw the ball back but instead would yell  “I’m going to tell my dad  I’m going to call the police ”Several people in the neighborhood fondly remembered the older Trumps bagging their own groceries when shopping along Union Turnpike  the northern border of the neighborhood  which now is increasingly modern Orthodox  One woman eating in a bagel shop on 188th Street had a less rosy memory of the Trumps “They lived right behind us ” said Chava Ben Amos  who recalled a time when Fred Trump asked her if he could put a television antenna on their roof  which  because it was higher than the Trumps’ home  could receive a clearer signal “We said  ‘Yes  but can we use it?’ “ Ms  Ben Amos said  “Can we connect it to our TV?”“They said ‘No ’ “ she said  “So we said  ‘Forget it ’ “Donald went to a private school on Union Turnpike and struck up a friendship with Peter Brant  who became a billionaire industrialist  art collector and tabloid fixture for his off again on again marriage to the former Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour “Peter and I loved sports ” Mr  Trump said They also loved causing trouble  leading his father to ship Mr  Trump to military school north of the city  From there  he went to college and into business with his father in Brooklyn before conquering Manhattan real estate “I wanted them to move into Trump Tower  and my mother loved the idea ” Mr  Trump said  “But my father really loved staying in Queens ”Decades later  Mr  Trump remains the area’s most famous son  While his former neighbor  Mr  Quint  had read Mr  Trump’s book  “The Art of the Deal ” and expressed confidence in Mr  Trump’s ability to build a wall along the Mexican border  the young woman who lived in his old house  Ms  Dabakarov  was less enthusiastic about his candidacy “This whole country will basically implode” if he is elected  she said  “He’s like a half century behind ”","headline":{"main":"Donald Trump’s Old Queens Neighborhood Contrasts With the

Looking at August alone  The Times ran 14 articles on Mr  Sanders  compared with 54 on Mrs  Clinton  Donald Trump – like Mr  Sanders  also considered by many an extreme long shot for his party’s nomination – got the most coverage last month  63 articles  Other Republican candidates received far less ink than Trump  Jeb Bush was the subject of 18 articles in August  and Marco Rubio  10   Of course  not all press is good press for any of the candidates  In Mrs  Clinton’s case  for example  many of the August articles dealt with her questionable email practices as secretary of state  So  in terms of numbers alone  The Times certainly has not ignored Mr  Sanders  The Times did get off to a very slow start with its Sanders coverage but has responded as the crowds at his events have grown What about the tone and content of the Sanders coverage? This is what really frustrates most of the readers I’ve heard from  They want the candidate  and the issues he raises – particularly those concerning income inequality – to be taken seriously  Instead  they say  there’s too much snark and too much fluff The fluff may have reached its zenith — at least  one can always hope — with an exchange included in a Times Magazine interview  Not a part of the Times political coverage  it was by a well known freelance contributor  Ana Marie Cox Do you think it’s fair that Hillary’s hair gets a lot more scrutiny than yours does?\nHillary’s hair gets more scrutiny than my hair?\nYeah  \nIs that what you’re asking?\nYeah  \nO K   Ana  I don’t mean to be rude here  I am running for president of the United States on serious issues  O K ? Do you have serious questions?Many readers also found this passage in an Aug  20 campaign trail article objectionable When a gaggle of reporters — “corporate media” in Sanders parlance — mentioned Mrs  Clinton here  he snarled  “That’s the sport you guys like ” meaning their focus on the kind of political questions he disdains  When asked to reconcile his anti establishment status with being a “career politician ” Mr  Sanders  who except for two years has held political office continually since 1981  glared at the young reporter who asked the question \n“Career politician?” he said to her with a disdainful laugh  “Other questions ”Constance Sullivan of Minneapolis wrote that it was “astonishingly inaccurate  “Sanders didn’t ‘snarl’  I have seen the video clip   He typically responds calmly and with cool reason that tends to deflate a lot of self important young reporters ”Regina Schrambling of Manhattan  a former Times writer and editor  wrote to me complaining about an early headline on a piece about Mr  Sanders’s popularity on Facebook and Reddit  It read  “A Grumpy Old Socialist and Social Media Sensation ”She couldn’t recall this sort of tone with any of the Republican “fringe candidates” as she put it  The article  too  she said  was dismissive “It seems the editors have decided the race already and have written him off ” she said Beyond the specifics of word choice  many readers have told me in emails and written in hundreds of passionate comments on news stories that they are deeply frustrated by coverage that doesn’t dig into the important issues plaguing the nation  particularly economic inequality and climate change And Dave Lippman of Teaneck  N J   complained about a circular system of news  in which “fringe candidates are not deserving of respect because they don’t have support because the press doesn’t treat them with respect ”It’s a given that Times editors and reporters must make news judgments about how much attention to give various candidates  That can vary widely  Since 2013  for example  The Times has assigned a reporter to cover Mrs  Clinton full time  arguably adding to her early anointment as the all but certain Democratic nominee  though many would argue that the coverage has been far from favorable Do these decisions merely recognize political reality or are they part of a self perpetuating cycle in which someone like Bernie Sanders can never stand a chance?On Tuesday  I asked Carolyn Ryan  the senior editor who heads The Times’s political coverage  for her response  I also sent her a summary of the numbers and the reader complaints   Update  I published her response in a separate post  Here’s my take  The Times has not ignored Mr  Sanders’s campaign  but it hasn’t always taken it very seriously  The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive  even mocking at times  Some of that is focused on the candidate’s age  appearance and style  rather than what he has to say And then there’s the Trump factor  While it may be realistic  and reflective of reasonable news judgment  to give Mr  Sanders less coverage than Mrs  Clinton  that’s certainly not happening with Donald Trump – whose every utterance and dust up is breathlessly chronicled The Times’s executive editor  Dean Baquet  told me recently that he wants to focus more heavily on issue stories in the coming weeks and months  Candidates like Mr  Sanders – no matter how electable they are seen as – can and should be a part of that  Times readers are completely within their rights to expect and demand it ","headline":{"main":"Has The Times Dismissed Bernie Sanders?","kicker":"The Public Editor&#039;s Journal"},"wordCount":"1223"},

It’s simple  Because he can “play to people’s fantasies ” as Mr  Trump puts it  The man knows his television  loves money  hates rules  tells jokes  uses bad language and is convivial to a fault  He may not be like us  but he makes sure there’s something about him that different people can relate to  personally As both Mr  Trump and Mr  Berlusconi know  once you have the people on the hook  you can sell them anything  and they’ll forgive you for everything  His appalling remarks about women and foreign countries? A sign of authenticity  say his admirers To dismiss Mr  Trump as a joke  as many Italians did with Mr  Berlusconi early on  and many Americans continue to do with Mr  Trump  would be a mistake  To take him seriously is also wrong  So use your sense of humor  Don’t take umbrage at his every offensive comment  his supporters don’t care  and the added chatter only helps him Next  don’t obsess over him  The American news and social media seem hypnotized by Mr  Trump  That’s not surprising  He is unusual  and heaven knows Western countries need some spice in the democratic process But to obsess over him is exactly what the man wants  “You see?” he can say  “They all gang up on me  those establishment types ” Ross Perot took advantage of the media’s love for the odd and novel in 1992  today  thanks to the Internet  it’s easier to spread the word Soon Mr  Trump’s act will become repetitive  so just speed up the process  Make him boring  Force him to be specific  For now  he can ignore questions about how  exactly  he would deport the estimated 11 million immigrants living in America without legal papers  Don’t stop asking  Eventually people will see through his charade  It might not seem that way now  but trust me — it worked with Mr  Berlusconi  once we figured out how to do it Third  don’t forget his miscues and misrepresentations  Right now Americans are drawn to Mr  Trump’s pragmatism  both in his life and his politics  But that won’t last  Americans also don’t like being lied to  and as the campaign season lengthens  there will be a lot of opportunities to point out instances of what I’ll delicately call “tactical amnesia” on Mr  Trump’s part  Candidates have lost for these sorts of mistakes  Don’t let Mr  Trump get away with it  We gave Mr  Berlusconi a lot of leeway in that department  and he took all of it Another similarity between Mr  Trump and Mr  Berlusconi is that they both bring to politics a flair for seduction that served them well in their previous careers in construction  television and entertainment  and elsewhere  or so it’s said   They know their message ought to be reassuring and easily digestible  Both are convinced that  in an era obsessed with appearances  image is key So  especially for those on the fence about supporting Mr  Trump  according to polls  a surprisingly large number of Americans   Don’t buy  Behave as you would with a chatty car salesman  Ask lots of questions  and expect proper answers  Open the trunk  check the brakes  Just don’t ask for a test drive — Mr  Trump may lock the door  speed away and drive you into the next wall Finally  don’t dig yourself into a hole  Margaret Thatcher’s classic acronym  TINA — There Is No Alternative — says it all about the attitude of many voters  Before choosing what they think is right  they consider what they believe to be possible  Mr  Berlusconi lasted as long as he did for lack of alternatives  Mr  Trump is banking on the creation of a self fulfilling narrative  that even if he is not the best candidate  he is the only viable candidate But of course  that’s true only if the public and the media let it be true — the Republicans have 16 hats in the ring  and several of them  from across the right wing spectrum  offer a saner option for the presidency than Mr  Trump  All it takes is the establishment’s rallying behind one of them  but they have to do it soon While Mr  Trump might be new to politics  Trumpism — which is to say the offensive masking themselves as “honest ” the unprepared masking themselves as “fresh” — is an ancient story  “People take pleasure in giving power to the indecent ” wrote Seneca  2 000 years ago  But they pay for this  sooner or later  And with Mr  Trump  it may be sooner ","headline":{"main":"What Italy Can Teach America About Donald Trump","content_kicker":"Contributing Op-Ed Writer","kicker":"Op-Ed | Beppe Severgnini","print_headline":"What Italy can teach America about Donald Trump"},"wordCount":"905"},

I feel like I won the lottery or something ” Hazel Thomas  53  said upon learning last week that the elder Mr  Trump had built the compact beige stucco house with maroon trim she has owned since 2002

laughed  “Some of them are really far out views ” Another laugh  “I’m a registered Democrat ”Still  she felt compelled to add  “It’s a beautiful home  It’s really a strong house  it really is  I have to say that about it  He did a wonderful job ”Over the course of seven decades of erecting houses and high rises across Brooklyn and Queens  Fred Trump earned a reputation as a meticulous developer  the kind who punctually repainted the ironwork and  to save money  mixed his own disinfectant  Born to German immigrants  he built his first house in Woodhaven  Queens  within two years of graduating from high school  according to “The Trumps  Three Generations That Built an Empire ” by Gwenda Blair The next two houses went up in Queens Village  But by 1926  three years after graduation  Mr  Trump had found a neighborhood to match his ambitions in Hollis  a middle class community rising as fast as developers could put up new houses  Too young to sign checks  he teamed up with his mother  Elizabeth  to form E  Trump   Son The classified advertisements of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle  The Queens Leader Observer and other local newspapers became showcases for his plans  “Why not visit ” one ad for an E  Trump   Son model home shouted  more command than suggestion  “Located in the very best section of Hollis only 5 minutes from the station  having every city convenience  including sewers  concrete street and sidewalks ” The price was listed at  9 950  though the company sold some homes around the same time for as little as  3 990 William Socolow of Brooklyn was among those who bit  buying one of six Trump homes on 198th Street between 110th and 111th Avenues in July 1926 — the same house Ms  Thomas would buy nearly 80 years later  Like its five neighbors  it had three windows on the first floor facing the street  a dormer window above  an attic and four steps leading to the front door Inside were a spacious living room  a dining room with parquet flooring and a kitchen with a breakfast nook  A small garage was in the back “It was a nice house to grow up in  Not a mansion  but a nice home ” said Adrienne Wollenberg  89  Mr  Socolow’s second of three daughters  “It stood us well through the years ”By the time Constance Robinson Turner’s family bought the house next door in the 1960s  the neighborhood was beginning to fill with upwardly mobile black families like hers  the kinds of families who still dominate the area today  The names of local real estate barons — Stark  LeFrak  Trump — adorn several buildings there  But Ms  Robinson Turner did not know about her home’s Trump connection until last week “From what I’ve heard  he was someone who was a people’s person  someone who was empowering and uplifting middle class people ” Ms  Robinson Turner  a university health care administrator  said of the elder Mr  Trump And the younger?“I hope he’ll remember the legacy of his father ” she said in a tone that suggested he had failed to do so thus far Ron Walker  41  an electrician who lives in a two story home clad in white siding several blocks from Ms  Robinson Turner’s  was delighted to learn of his Trump connection  The closest he had come to a Trump affiliation before this  he said  was doing some electrical work at Trump Village  Fred Trump’s middle income housing development in Coney Island  Brooklyn It was “just awesome ” he said of his link to his preferred presidential candidate  “a very smart man” who “knows business and knows how to run things ”Mr  Walker said he was a registered Democrat  but would be willing to switch parties to vote for Mr  Trump  “You know the looks I get when I’m wearing this?” he said  flourishing a “Trump 2016” T shirt When the real estate business crumbled during the Great Depression  Fred Trump took a brief but profitable detour into food  opening Queens’s first supermarket  Months later  he sold Trump Market to the King Kullen chain and returned to developing That building is still a grocery store  but the location of his first house in Woodhaven is unclear  At the time  no one was keeping track “He was well known around here  but it’s kind of like  who knew that was going to be important?” Ed Wendell  the president of the Woodhaven Cultural and Historical Society  said  “It’s not really a monumental achievement  opening a supermarket — you know what I mean?”By the time he died in 1999  Fred Trump had accomplished enough that the organization erected a plaque in his honor at the edge of the store’s parking lot “Began building at 15  built this store  founded E  Trump   Son now Trump Organization ” it reads  “Father of ‘The Donald ’ ”","headline":{"main":"Foundation of an Empire: Modest Queens Homes, Built by Donald Trump’s Father","content_kicker":"The

As of last month  the U S  unemployment rate  which was 7 8 percent when Mr  Obama took office  had fallen to 5 1 percent  For the record  Mr  Romney promised during the campaign that he would get unemployment down to 6 percent by the end of 2016  Also for the record  the current unemployment rate is lower than it ever got under Ronald Reagan  And the main reason unemployment has fallen so much is job growth in the private sector  which has added more than seven million workers since the end of 2012 I’m not saying that everything is great in the U S  economy  because it isn’t  There’s good reason to believe that we’re still a substantial distance from full employment  and while the number of jobs has grown a lot  wages haven’t  But the economy has nonetheless done far better than should have been possible if conservative orthodoxy had any truth to it  And now Mr  Trump is being accused of heresy for not accepting that failed orthodoxy?So am I saying that Mr  Trump is better and more serious than he’s given credit for being? Not at all — he is exactly the ignorant blowhard he seems to be  It’s when it comes to his rivals that appearances can be deceiving  Some of them may come across as reasonable and thoughtful  but in reality they are anything but Mr  Bush  in particular  may pose as a reasonable  thoughtful type — credulous reporters even describe him as a policy wonk — but his actual economic platform  which relies on the magic of tax cuts to deliver a doubling of America’s growth rate  is pure supply side voodoo And here’s what’s interesting  all indications are that Mr  Bush’s attacks on Mr  Trump are falling flat  because the Republican base doesn’t actually share the Republican establishment’s economic delusions The thing is  we didn’t really know that until Mr  Trump came along  The influence of big money donors meant that nobody could make a serious play for the G O P  nomination without pledging allegiance to supply side doctrine  and this allowed the establishment to imagine that ordinary voters shared its antipopulist creed  Indeed  Mr  Bush’s hapless attempt at a takedown suggests that his political team still doesn’t get it  and thinks that pointing out The Donald’s heresies will be enough to doom his campaign But Mr  Trump  who is self financing  didn’t need to genuflect to the big money  and it turns out that the base doesn’t mind his heresies  This is a real revelation  which may have a lasting impact on our politics Again  I’m not making a case for Mr  Trump  There are lots of other politicians out there who also refuse to buy into right wing economic nonsense  but who do so without proposing to scour the countryside in search of immigrants to deport  or to rip up our international economic agreements and start a trade war  The point  however  is that none of these reasonable politicians is seeking the Republican presidential nomination ","headline":{"main":"Trump Is Right on Economics","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"Trump Is Right"},"wordCount":"816"},

but especially the one that ended after he was said to have started romancing his soon to be second wife during church Or the time he held a news conference to declare that he had personally inspected topless photographs of a Miss Universe contestant and found nothing distasteful or disqualifying about them  “In many cases  they were actually lovely pictures ” he said Then there were his irreverent remarks on how Holy Communion was his way of asking God to forgive him — not that he had anything to be sorry for “When I drink my little wine ” he said recently to an audience of somewhat baffled evangelical Christians in Iowa  “and have my little cracker  I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness ”There are many ways that Donald J  Trump is an improbable fit as the Republican standard bearer  his past support for abortion rights  his previous advocacy for a single payer health care plan  his changing positions and general disregard for party orthodoxy But Mr  Trump also faces a different and  in some ways  deeper divide with the social and religious conservatives so essential to the party he seeks to lead  For some of them  Mr  Trump’s Manhattan lifestyle  his celebration of decadence  and his lack of humility and religiosity make him seem alien to their lives and their values “There’s a conflict of worldviews  and it’s really serious ” said Penny Young Nance  the president of Concerned Women for America  a group of culturally and socially conservative women When the next president is faced with a life or death decision  she added  it is important to know that he or she will “get down on their knees and seek God’s direction ”That is not something she said she can imagine Mr  Trump doing  “It’s important to us that where you’re drawing your worldview  your compass  it’s not just based on your gut ” Ms  Nance said  “We don’t think anyone is that blessed or thoughtful or smart  We think you need God ”That dissonance is something that Mr  Trump’s rivals are trying to bring to the attention of religious voters  Last week  former Gov  Jeb Bush of Florida released a video that highlighted Mr  Trump’s previous liberal ideas and New York sensibility “I lived in New York City and Manhattan all my life  O K   so my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa ” Mr  Trump is shown saying in an old television interview  explaining why his views were different from those of many Republicans And Ben Carson  the retired pediatric neurosurgeon who is running second to Mr  Trump in some recent polls  said Wednesday that while his faith is “a very big part of who I am ” he doubts that is true for Mr  Trump  “I don’t get that impression with him ” he said Few recent episodes have illustrated how differently Mr  Trump sees the world than his comments on Planned Parenthood  some social conservative leaders complain  On the question of whether to strip the organization of its  500 million in federal funding  he has said that he would but that he also believes it should be evaluated as more than just an abortion provider  The issue will be debated in Congress in the coming weeks “I would look at the good aspects of it ” he told CNN  “And I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good  good for women  and I would look at that ”Few Republicans today would dare utter anything complimentary about Planned Parenthood  which is such a contentious subject that several candidates for president have said they would like to see the effort within Congress to eliminate the organization’s funding escalate into a government shutdown if necessary Making matters worse  when NBC News asked Mr  Trump whether he had ever donated money to the group  he said he could not recall because he had given hundreds of millions of dollars to various charities over his lifetime   His campaign later clarified that he had not given to Planned Parenthood  Anti abortion groups have denounced him  saying he appeared to be hedging in a way that seems antithetical to the Trump straight talk his supporters admire “He’s the last person to want to please everyone all the time  and he shouldn’t be trying to please everyone on this ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser  the president of the Susan B  Anthony List  an anti abortion group  “When somebody seems like they’re trying to have it both ways  they often are ”Religion and spirituality do play a role in his life  Mr  Trump insists  even if he does not wear his church affiliation  Presbyterian  on his sleeve Mr  Trump says he attends church regularly  unlike the television personality he styles himself on who also had a pompadour and political views that evolved to become more conservative  Ronald Reagan Mr  Trump was said to have rendezvoused with Marla Maples  who would become his second wife  during Sunday services at the Marble Collegiate Church on West 29th Street in Manhattan   Reagan also divorced and remarried  Mr  Trump professes a love for the Bible  “Nothing beats the Bible ” he said recently at a rally in Michigan  “Not even ‘The Art of the Deal ’ Not even close ”  “The Art of the Deal“ is one of his books  He also barely touches alcohol  And he has been active in philanthropy since his early days as a New York developer  He was known to occasionally send money to down on their luck people he had read about in the newspaper Still  among conservatives  Mr  Trump has his defenders  which is sometimes puzzling to those on the right who try to call him out “I  for the life of me  can’t figure it out ” said Josh Kimbrell  host of a conservative  Christian oriented radio program broadcast from Greenville  S C Mr  Kimbrell said that whenever he is hard on Mr  Trump on the air  he gets pushback from some of his listeners almost immediately “It’s almost like willful disbelief that the guy is a conservative ” he said Most visibly  Mr  Trump has tangled with another conservative radio host  Erick Erickson  who has a national evangelical Christian following  after his invitation to a candidates’ forum was revoked last month Mr  Erickson said that Mr  Trump’s comments about Megyn Kelly  the Fox News anchor who grilled him during the Republican presidential debate  were “a bridge too far” because they implied that she was hormonal and agitated “There are just real lines of decency a person running for president should not cross ” Mr  Erickson said at the time  Mr  Trump said he was misunderstood Still  Frank Luntz  the Republican consultant who was interviewing Mr  Trump in front of the evangelical audience in Iowa when he made the “cracker” comments about communion  said that he believed Mr  Trump’s reputation as a ruthless fighter was something that was appealing to Christian conservatives who believed their way of life was under assault Even after the “cracker” quip — “You could hear  audibly  shock in the room ” Mr  Luntz said — many people did not seem terribly bothered  “This is the Paul Simon principle of politics  A man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest ” Mr  Luntz said  summing up Mr  Trump’s enduring and paradoxical popularity with many Christian voters

{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/upshot/what-makes-a-tax-plan-serious-anyway.html","date":"2015-10-04T00:00:00Z","content":"In the 1998 film “There’s Something About Mary ” there is a scene where Ben Stiller’s character picks up a hitchhiking drifter  The drifter explains that he’s really a businessman  and he has an idea that will someday make him a fortune  Seven Minute Abs  a home exercise video that will produce the same great results as Eight Minute Abs  but in one minute less Mr  Stiller’s character responds that it sounds like a great idea  unless someone comes out with Six Minute Abs  The drifter  played by Harland Williams  gets angry  “Nobody’s coming up with six  Who works out in six minutes? You won’t even get your heart going ”With my apologies in advance for comparing him to an unhinged drifter  this is roughly what happened to Jeb Bush in September He came out with the tax policy version of Seven Minute Abs  a plan to cut taxes by  3 trillion to  4 trillion over a decade  with no need to worry about the budget because he’ll produce 4 percent economic growth  Just like Seven Minute Abs  it’s so easy  you might not even believe it’s possible Then Donald Trump responded with essentially the same plan  but bigger   11 trillion in tax cuts  economic growth as high as 6 percent  the biggest  classiest  most luxurious plan you’ve ever seen  Six  Minute  Abs Mr  Bush responded on Twitter  saying he was flattered by the similar structure of Mr  Trump’s tax plan but that Mr  Trump should have stuck with “fiscal responsibility ” Like that drifter  Mr  Bush was insisting that his own tantalizing plan was good  but if you cut one more corner you’d only be fooling yourself But what  exactly  makes  3 4 trillion a reasonable size for a tax cut and  11 trillion irresponsible? After all  rock hard abs in either six minutes or seven minutes is a dubious proposition  Is there reason to believe our government can handle a revenue loss of the size Mr  Bush wants  even if Mr  Trump has gone too far?“Like many things in public policy  degrees matter ” said Michael Strain  an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute  who was prepared to stick up for the view that Mr  Bush’s plan is serious and Mr  Trump’s plan is not  “When you look at the bones of it  there are certainly similarities — there’s no question about that — but two people can have very similar bone structure and one person can weigh 300 pounds and the other can weigh 150 pounds  and there’s a big difference between them ”Mr  Bush does appear to have done more homework than Mr  Trump  To back up his plan  Mr  Bush got a letter from four esteemed conservative economists  including Glenn Hubbard  the dean of the Columbia Business School  and Martin Feldstein of Harvard University  Those economists estimated that his plan would add 0 5 percent a year to economic growth for a decade  They didn’t claim that growth would fully offset the revenue loss from his tax cuts  though they did say it would offset about a third — and that other growth inducing changes would do more to close the revenue gap  along with spending cuts to be laid out in detail at  naturally  a later date As far as we can tell  Mr  Trump is his own economist  He said at a news conference on Monday that his tax plan  despite appearing to cut government revenue by a quarter  would actually be deficit neutral within three years  His campaign did not respond to a request for more detailed projections In other words  maybe Mr  Trump’s problem is that he has proposed not Six Minute Abs but Three Minute Abs “Trump doesn’t seem to be following the normal rules of the Republican primary  where you call for  to my mind  irresponsible tax cuts  but you at least don’t call for them so much that you can’t get a sympathetic foundation or economic adviser to say that they agree with it ” said Austan Goolsbee  a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama On the other hand  Mr  Bush’s letter from economists is less impressive than it looks at first  Since the federal government is already expected to run significant budget deficits for the foreseeable future  the proposition that tax cuts will lead to growth is essential for arguing that tax cuts are affordable  But the Hubbard group did not actually model the economic effects of Mr  Bush’s tax plan  it simply eyeballed an estimate based on other economists’ past papers estimating the effects of other tax plans Despite the confident prediction from Mr  Hubbard and his co authors  who called their growth estimate “conservative ” the interaction between tax policy and economic growth is a highly contested area of economics  The I G M  Economic Experts Panel  a survey of prominent economists conducted by the University of Chicago  is evenly split on the question of whether a cut in federal income tax rates would lead to an increase in economic output or whether the impact of such a cut is uncertain  Less than a third of the I G M  panelists said economic research “provides enough guidance to generate informative bounds” around the size of tax changes’ effects on growth  Yet that is exactly the sort of exercise that Mr  Hubbard et al  did for Mr  Bush on the back of an envelope and that Mr  Trump appears to have done in his head Even Mr  Strain  who says the Bush plan clears the bar of “seriousness ” would not go so far as to defend the estimates in the Hubbard letter “I think they’re on the high side ” he said  “It felt a little hand wavy when I read it ”Of course  we've seen this play before  when George W  Bush cut taxes in the early 2000s on the promise that tax cuts  especially on investments  would deliver strong economic growth  That time  the growth did not materialize  but all sorts of nontax factors also affect economic growth  which left economists plenty of room to continue debating the tax growth link The main argument for the superior seriousness of the Bush plan  compared with Mr  Trump’s  is that Mr  Bush is operating within some bounds  If you ask economists at major universities what a tax plan will do  you can get a wide range of answers  many of them overconfident  but you cannot get literally any answer Again  this is similar to the problem of Seven Minute Abs  It is surely possible to come up with a core workout regimen so transparently doomed to failure — Banana Split Abs  perhaps — that no infomercial pitchman would agree to sell it  But the mere existence of any boundary around your promises does not mean those promises will come true — whether they’re about abs or taxes ","headline":{"main":"What Makes a Tax Plan ‘Serious’

group of conservative writers and thinkers has urged the Republican party to rethink its economic agenda with a greater focus on the needs of the middle class  The so called reform conservatives have criticized the G O P ’s economic prescription of cutting entitlement programs and tax rates  especially on high earners  as unresponsive to the concerns of workers earning stagnant wages “Reform conservatism is based on a recognition that the American economy has not served middle income people well  not just since the crisis of 2008 but at least since the year 2000 ” said David Frum  the prominent Canadian American conservative journalist and former speechwriter for George W  Bush who serves as a senior editor at The Atlantic Though the reform conservatives dissent from conservative tax orthodoxy  they are not necessarily moderates  For example  many of them  including Mr  Frum  advocate a significantly more restrictive immigration policy  arguing that high immigration levels  particularly for low skilled workers  cut against the economic interests of ordinary Americans Hmm There happens to be a Republican candidate for president who wants less immigration but also thinks it’s “outrageous” how little tax some rich people pay  and he’s doing pretty well in the polls  Is Donald Trump the candidate the reformocons have been waiting for?“No ” Mr  Frum said But “He may be the jolt that the Republican Party needs to compromise its pro plutocratic agenda ” he said It’s an awkward thing  The reform conservative movement  to the extent it exists  is pointy headed  technocratic and soft spoken  Mr  Trump is none of those things  But his campaign has helped bolster a key argument from the reformocons  that many Republican voters are not devotees of supply side economics and are more interested in the right kind of government than in a simply smaller one “There were a lot of people who wanted to think the Tea Party is a straightforward libertarian movement ” said Reihan Salam  the executive editor of National Review  But he said Mr  Trump’s ability to lead the polls while attacking Republicans for wanting to cut entitlement programs showed that conservative voters are open to “government programs that help the right people ”Mr  Frum attributes most Republican candidates’ continued devotion to cuts in taxes and entitlements to the desires of a Republican donor class that benefits directly from lower tax rates and indirectly  through lower labor costs  from high immigration  Mr  Trump  as Mr  Trump will happily tell you  does not need rich donors’ money  and the polls show that Republican voters have not yet punished him for his praise of single payer health care  in other countries  or his past support for a wealth tax “Trump served notice that the donors’ platform isn’t even acceptable inside the party ” Mr  Frum said Of course  there are reasons the reformocons have not lined up to support Mr  Trump  Just because he has identified some of the same problems as the reformocons does not mean they agree on solutions “I would not characterize Mr  Trump’s campaign so far as a policy driven campaign to help the middle class ” said Michael Strain  an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who has urged conservatives to adopt more creative solutions to address the weak job market  He took particular issue with Mr  Trump’s support for higher tariffs and his apparent disregard for long term deficits Even those reformocons who are immigration hawks do not necessarily find much to love in Mr  Trump’s agenda  In an email  Yuval Levin  the editor of the conservative policy journal National Affairs  wrote that Mr  Trump “has confounded what I take to be some reasonable ideas  like a tempering of future immigration rates  with what I take to be some very unreasonable ideas  like deporting 12 million people  in a way that doesn’t help the more reasonable ones get heard ”There are also  of course  the insults  Mr  Salam favors a more restrictive immigration policy and would like to see more candidates speaking thoughtfully about issues of assimilation and integration  But he adds  “When it seems like you’re demonizing that population  that’s completely counterproductive ”Still  Mr  Trump could be a useful stalking horse for the reformocons even if they think he has bad policy ideas  says a lot of offensive things  can’t win an election and wouldn’t be a good president “If Trump isn’t offering workable solutions but he is identifying problems that others have ignored  the hope is some more policy focused  more governance focused competitor will make use of the opportunity that Trump has publicized ” Mr  Frum said In an analogy that won’t make anyone very comfortable  he said Mr  Trump could be useful in the same way George Wallace was in 1968  “Wallace talked about a lot of issues  many of them pretty dismaying  but he also seized on the crime issue  Crime was rising fast  and it was not an issue that respectable politicians wanted to talk about  The result was that Richard Nixon stole his issue and deracialized it ”Well  not exactly  Pressed on whether Nixon’s anticrime language could really be considered deracialized  Mr  Frum argued Nixon “diminished its racialism and incorporated it into something like a workable policy agenda ”If Mr  Trump is Wallace in this analogy  then the reform conservatives are still waiting for their Nixon  Whether that’s a hopeful prospect or an alarming one is up to you ","headline":{"main":"Is Trump the Candidate Reform

the exposure it brings to something obscure and forgotten — like Denmark  Who doesn’t love a country that gave us a dish of frikadeller and rugbrod to go with paid parental leave and universal health care?“I love Denmark ” said Hillary Clinton during Tuesday’s debate  by way of dismissing a quasi socialist nation of 5 7 million mostly white people as not the best place to look for solving the problems of a multiethnic democracy of 322 million But in fact  the United States may be closer to Denmark than many think  In the reddest of red states — say  Idaho — you can find the kind of socialism  through publicly owned utilities or the federal dam that farmers rely on for their water  that would be right at home among aquavit sipping Danes Once you label something socialist  it brings to mind dour Soviet types trotting out dreary worker clothing for the spring fashion line  Or  here at home  those insufferable parlor room Marxists who think it would be utopia if only we nationalized every Starbucks  In that sense  the worst thing about socialism is the socialists Free of the label  a hybrid economy where health care  education and pensions for the elderly are provided  side by side by side with creative capitalism  works pretty well in the Nordic countries  Britain and Canada  And most of the tenets of what is considered democratic socialism have majority support in the United States But “socialism” as a word is poison in this country  except among the young  in large part because it’s associated with failed authoritarian Marxist states  A recent Gallup poll found that half of Americans would not vote for a socialist  More people said they could accept an atheist as president than someone with the scarlet S So we don’t like “them ” But we do like many of their ideas  We can thank Senator Bernie Sanders  self proclaimed democratic socialist  for this healthy debate  This week  Donald Trump called him a “communist ” If so  you can find broad public support for most of the things advocated by the commie from Brooklyn A majority of Americans feel “money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed ” according to a CBS News New York Times poll  Sanders wants to raise the minimum wage  so do 71 percent of Americans  Sanders believes corporations have too much influence on politics  as do 74 percent of Americans  And one of the biggest socialist programs — the single payer Medicare system that is a lifeline to more than 50 million people — is also one of the most popular Nearly one in four people in this country gets electricity from a consumer owned or co op utility — socialism throughout the heartland  And when President Obama considered privatizing a big government utility and dam operator  the Tennessee Valley Authority  he was met with squawks of protest from some of the most conservative precincts in America Obama is no socialist  A socialist would have nationalized General Motors  instead of returning it to capitalistic solvency  A socialist would not have presided over a doubling of the stock market  without adding significant new taxes to Wall Street’s biggest beneficiaries For true socialism in action  look to the billionaire Trump  As a developer  he’s tried to use eminent domain — “state sanctioned thievery ” in the words of National Review Online — to get other people’s property  There’s your communist  He has no problem taking from others to serve the public “good ”Capitalism at its best gives us iPhones and 400 kinds of ice cream and rewards enterprise and innovation  The free market has no small amount of magic  At its worst  capitalism produces pharmaceutical companies that gouge for lifesaving drugs  insurance companies that drop people once they get sick  and a system where secretaries pay a higher percentage of their earnings in taxes than billionaires who do nothing Socialism at its best can run an army  a health care system and provide quality education for those who otherwise couldn’t afford one  Libraries and fire departments are socialist institutions  So is the Interstate System of highways created under President Eisenhower  Ditto the nation’s most popular cultural enterprise  the National Football League  which shares its television billions with losers among the teams  At its worst  socialism is grim and stifling  a dead end for creativity The key is to find a balance  as Hillary Clinton said in Tuesday’s debate  “Our job is to rein in the excesses of capitalism so it doesn’t run amok ” she said  In that sentiment  you could hear the historical echo of two great progressive presidents  Teddy Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin  both of whom sought to save capitalism from itself She also said  “We are not Denmark ” Nope  Not by any stretch  Denmark has a slightly higher tax load on its citizens than the United States  But it also has budget surpluses  universal health care  shorter working hours  and was recently rated by

high cost of a prescription drug  drug makers tend to have two main defenses  One is that developing drugs is an expensive  risky endeavor  and so companies need high prices to cover the cost of medical research  The second is that their products bring value by improving health and wellness  and the companies should be rewarded for those public benefits Hillary Rodham Clinton is unveiling her proposal to lower drug costs Tuesday  and she has taken aim squarely at that first defense  If companies really need high prices to spend it on science  then they should be required to spend a set amount of their revenue on research and development costs  She proposes requiring that any additional drug company revenue be plowed back into government research for new therapies  The proposal would apply to any drug company that benefits from federal support — which would mean most of them “The drug industry argues that high prices are necessary to pay for research and development  so let’s take them up on that argument ” said Topher Spiro  the vice president for health policy at the left leaning Center for American Progress  which published a paper last week endorsing a similar idea  “Let’s have a relationship between prices and spending on research and development ”It’s a feel good idea that calls on the companies to account for their claims that they are research entities  But when I ran it by some health economists and other health policy experts  several strongly disliked the idea because it misunderstands the diversity of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  They say it would create perverse incentives that could raise instead of lower the costs of developing new drugs “This is an astonishingly naïve approach ” said Amitabh Chandra  a professor of public policy at Harvard University  in an email  He argues that the plan could encourage wasteful research spending without necessarily doing much about the prices charged for medications The proposal takes its inspiration from a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires health insurers to spend about 80 percent of the revenue that customers pay as insurance premiums on medical care  That provision has been popular  because the insurers that overcharge are required to send rebate checks to their customers  And though critics warned that it could reward inefficient spending on medical care  this does not seem to be happening so far  Early research suggests the measure has held down premiums But the drug industry is different from health insurance in some important ways  For one  in recent decades companies have become much more specialized  Some small biotech start ups develop only one drug  Other companies are focused only on basic research  they sell their discoveries to larger companies  Still others are the buyers of those technologies  specializing in clinical trials  navigating the drug approval process and bringing drugs to market  And there are the big pharmaceutical companies  which tend to do everything from basic research to sales A set ratio of research spending and revenue would most likely bring about a reshuffling of the industry  said Dr  Scott Gottlieb  a scholar at the right leaning American Enterprise Institute who serves on the boards of several pharmaceutical companies  “There’s no uniform business model in the drug industry ” he said  That means it could be hard to have a ratio that would apply appropriately across all the different categories of companies The idea behind the plan is that it would pressure companies to spend less on marketing  overhead and executive pay  and to consider lowering their drug prices in cases where there’s a mismatch between revenue and research budgets  It might discourage companies from buying products that are close to market ready  and then charging high prices for them  Mr  Spiro pointed to two examples in which that has happened  Sovaldi  an expensive drug for hepatitis C  which was purchased by Gilead Pharmaceuticals after it was partway through clinical trials  and Daraprim  a generic anti parasitic drug that was recently acquired by Turing Pharmaceuticals  which rapidly increased its price from  13 50 to  750 for a pill  The rule would force those companies to charge far less  Mr  Spiro said  since they spent little on research and won’t spend a lot on manufacturing the pills But critics worry that drug companies might instead stick with their prices and then pour more money into new forms of research  even if they don’t have good ideas or won’t provide much public benefit with the work “Saying every company ought to spend a given amount on R D is not an efficient way to encourage more R D  if that is the objective here ” said Patricia Danzon  a professor at Wharton  the University of Pennsylvania’s business school  who studies pharmaceutical pricing regulation Mrs  Clinton’s plan is still sketchy in its details  Her campaign staff has not yet said what percentage of a drug company’s revenue must be spent on research  or what time period the ratio would apply to  Some of those details may come to ameliorate critics’ concerns  Mr  Spiro said that the details about what would count as research spending might be defined in a way that would apply to a broad array of companies in the drug industry It also comes as part of a package of reforms on drugs  Mrs  Clinton would further change the company’s business strategies by eliminating the tax deductibility of marketing costs  She would force insurance companies to limit how much customers could be asked to pay for drugs each month  She would require Medicare to negotiate directly with drugmakers on prices  and allow American customers to import drugs manufactured in other countries Mrs  Clinton’s choice is interesting not just because it is relatively novel in the health policy debate  but also because it represents a strategy very different from the one used in nearly every other developed country to constrain drug spending  What most countries do is develop some system for evaluating the medical value of new products  and negotiate prices based on that value  Such an approach  which measures how much a given medication would improve people’s life span and quality of life  is relatively rare in the United States  though there is growing interest in such a metric Dr  Ezekiel Emanuel  a University of Pennsylvania professor who worked on the Center for American Progress proposal and is a former adviser to the Obama White House  said the goal should be a system that rewards innovation and improvements in health  The ratio  he said  is one way of nudging the system in that direction  “Exactly how we get to that in the political system that we have I think is complicated  and you may not be able to get there directly in a way that policy wonks would want ” he said The ratio approach makes some sense as a tool to regulate pharmaceutical companies in an environment where it is difficult to attack price directly  says Dr  Peter Bach  the director of the center for health policy and outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  and a vocal critic of many recent high prices attached to new cancer drugs  But he says he hopes the American system finds a way to measure and reward companies that provide medical value  not just those that spend a lot on research  “Can we get to a value based price so companies win for making better products  not for playing the system more cleverly?” he asked ","headline":{"main":"Why Some Policy Experts Question Clinton’s

Mrs  Clinton still has tremendous advantages in the Democratic primaries and remains a clear favorite for the nomination  She commands overwhelming support from the party’s elite  which has given her a big financial advantage  attracted a robust national organization full of the party’s most talented operatives  and deterred mainstream challengers  Her policy views are right in the middle of the Democratic Party  even if there is room to challenge her from the left in Iowa and New Hampshire  there is little room to do so in the rest of the nation’s primaries But Mrs  Clinton’s decline now extends beyond what I  at least  would have expected  It is still not enough to call her advantage into question  but it suggests that many analysts might have underestimated the resonance of the controversy surrounding her private email account and server at the State Department  And it creates a real quandary for Mr  Biden For the first time in Mrs  Clinton’s two decades in national politics  more Americans see her unfavorably than favorably  Her net favorability rating — now a dismal minus 10 or perhaps worse — is at least 15 points worse than it was at this time in 2008 She hasn’t lost ground only among Republicans or Republican leaning independents  but also among Democratic voters  I don’t have a comprehensive data set of Mrs  Clinton’s old favorability ratings among Democrats  but a quick survey of polls from August and September 2007 showed Mrs  Clinton with 80 percent to 88 percent favorability ratings among Democrats  Today  they range from 65 percent to 77 percent  That shouldn’t be a surprise  given how far her national ratings have slipped It is hard to argue that these losses were inevitable  given that they now place her beneath where she was in the last 2008 primary — a contest she entered with far less support from voters and party elites than she held at the beginning of this year  They raise the possibility that political scientists and data journalists — including this one — have underestimated the significance of the email affair  which is the simplest — if unproven — explanation for those losses The email controversy is unusual  There has been no indictment or even allegations of criminality  But whether it’s a true scandal or not  by now it has all of the trappings of one  generating an F B I  investigation  congressional hearings  an aide’s pleading of the Fifth Amendment  lawyerly explanations about the deletion of documents  It has dragged on for months and fits into a longstanding narrative of the Clintons’ trouble with honesty The faster decline in Mrs  Clinton’s standing began in mid July  when the F B I  began an investigation into the release of classified information in her email account  It was also about the time when Mr  Biden began investigating entering the race Most data journalists and political scientists had argued that the email revelations were just another muddled  politicized dispute that would quickly split the electorate along partisan lines  But recent surveys — like an ABC Washington Post survey from this week — show that a significant minority of Democrats  29 percent to 33 percent  depending on the question  disapprove of her handling of questions about her email account  think she broke government regulations or think she tried to cover up the facts Perhaps all of these voters would have opposed her in the primary anyway  Mrs  Clinton  after all  still has a big lead in national polls  It’s no longer a record setting advantage  But it’s a big one  and it’s underpinned by all of the fundamentals that help determine the outcome of the primary contest  This time  she won’t be facing a candidate  like Barack Obama  who has the potential to peel away a big part of her coalition Party elites haven’t begun to leave her candidacy either  Over the last month  Mrs  Clinton has rolled out still more endorsements  Reports from a meeting of the Democratic National Committee suggested that few party members were itching to jump ship So if the damage is done  if saying “sorry” marks the moment when the controversy begins to fade  if the investigation doesn’t take any future turns for the worse  then Mrs  Clinton could remain in a strong position to win the nomination  She could probably recover ground — both in terms of her ratings and in the early primary states  The “Clinton Comeback” narrative  almost as familiar as the scandal prone one  would emerge in a matter of time But it’s impossible to rule out the possibility that the email investigation — or its effect on public opinion — could take a new turn Mrs  Clinton’s poll numbers — both in the Democratic primary or among all Americans — can’t afford to fall too much further before party leaders would justifiably begin to reassess her candidacy That creates a real problem for Mr  Biden  He seems genuinely conflicted about whether to run for president  even setting aside his grief and anguish after the death of his son Beau He’s considering a run at a highly unusual moment  He would be well positioned to capitalize if Mrs  Clinton faltered  But he would probably lose by a wide margin if the race stayed as it is  He might not win even one state  He would lack the resources and elite support necessary to build a competitive national campaign at this stage  and there just might not be an opening But one thing is clear  He doesn’t have much more time to wait and see if the Clinton campaign founders ","headline":{"main":"Signs of Hillary Clinton’s Troubles, in

the exposure it brings to something obscure and forgotten — like Denmark  Who doesn’t love a country that gave us a dish of frikadeller and rugbrod to go with paid parental leave and universal health care?“I love Denmark ” said Hillary Clinton during Tuesday’s debate  by way of dismissing a quasi socialist nation of 5 7 million mostly white people as not the best place to look for solving the problems of a multiethnic democracy of 322 million But in fact  the United States may be closer to Denmark than many think  In the reddest of red states — say  Idaho — you can find the kind of socialism  through publicly owned utilities or the federal dam that farmers rely on for their water  that would be right at home among aquavit sipping Danes Once you label something socialist  it brings to mind dour Soviet types trotting out dreary worker clothing for the spring fashion line  Or  here at home  those insufferable parlor room Marxists who think it would be utopia if only we nationalized every Starbucks  In that sense  the worst thing about socialism is the socialists Free of the label  a hybrid economy where health care  education and pensions for the elderly are provided  side by side by side with creative capitalism  works pretty well in the Nordic countries  Britain and Canada  And most of the tenets of what is considered democratic socialism have majority support in the United States But “socialism” as a word is poison in this country  except among the young  in large part because it’s associated with failed authoritarian Marxist states  A recent Gallup poll found that half of Americans would not vote for a socialist  More people said they could accept an atheist as president than someone with the scarlet S So we don’t like “them ” But we do like many of their ideas  We can thank Senator Bernie Sanders  self proclaimed democratic socialist  for this healthy debate  This week  Donald Trump called him a “communist ” If so  you can find broad public support for most of the things advocated by the commie from Brooklyn A majority of Americans feel “money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed ” according to a CBS News New York Times poll  Sanders wants to raise the minimum wage  so do 71 percent of Americans  Sanders believes corporations have too much influence on politics  as do 74 percent of Americans  And one of the biggest socialist programs — the single payer Medicare system that is a lifeline to more than 50 million people — is also one of the most popular Nearly one in four people in this country gets electricity from a consumer owned or co op utility — socialism throughout the heartland  And when President Obama considered privatizing a big government utility and dam operator  the Tennessee Valley Authority  he was met with squawks of protest from some of the most conservative precincts in America Obama is no socialist  A socialist would have nationalized General Motors  instead of returning it to capitalistic solvency  A socialist would not have presided over a doubling of the stock market  without adding significant new taxes to Wall Street’s biggest beneficiaries For true socialism in action  look to the billionaire Trump  As a developer  he’s tried to use eminent domain — “state sanctioned thievery ” in the words of National Review Online — to get other people’s property  There’s your communist  He has no problem taking from others to serve the public “good ”Capitalism at its best gives us iPhones and 400 kinds of ice cream and rewards enterprise and innovation  The free market has no small amount of magic  At its worst  capitalism produces pharmaceutical companies that gouge for lifesaving drugs  insurance companies that drop people once they get sick  and a system where secretaries pay a higher percentage of their earnings in taxes than billionaires who do nothing Socialism at its best can run an army  a health care system and provide quality education for those who otherwise couldn’t afford one  Libraries and fire departments are socialist institutions  So is the Interstate System of highways created under President Eisenhower  Ditto the nation’s most popular cultural enterprise  the National Football League  which shares its television billions with losers among the teams  At its worst  socialism is grim and stifling  a dead end for creativity The key is to find a balance  as Hillary Clinton said in Tuesday’s debate  “Our job is to rein in the excesses of capitalism so it doesn’t run amok ” she said  In that sentiment  you could hear the historical echo of two great progressive presidents  Teddy Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin  both of whom sought to save capitalism from itself She also said  “We are not Denmark ” Nope  Not by any stretch  Denmark has a slightly higher tax load on its citizens than the United States  But it also has budget surpluses  universal health care  shorter working hours  and was recently rated by

Situation Room  the ultimate team of rivals confronting the world’s thorniest problems  mostly on the same page  sometimes decidedly not  but generally presenting a united front to the outside world Now  with the administration’s approach to Syria seemingly in tatters  the differences between President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have opened a fresh wedge between the two  with Mrs  Clinton arguing for a more robust approach and Mr  Obama dismissing her ideas as campaign politics The exchange over the last two days brings to the fore a split on policy that has long divided the current president and his putative heir apparent  but it also reinforces the challenge for a Democratic candidate to define her own approach without alienating the incumbent head of her party  A serious debate in the Situation Room now plays itself out on the campaign trail with all the inherent stress points The Syria schism is just one of several areas where Mrs  Clinton has departed from the administration in recent weeks  She came out against the Keystone XL pipeline last month  while the administration remains undecided  She opposed drilling for oil in the Arctic just after the administration granted permits to Royal Dutch Shell to do so She said she would probably have voted against a measure granting Mr  Obama so called fast track authority to negotiate an Asian Pacific trade agreement  And a few weeks ago  she said the Obama administration has “not done enough” to impose costs on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine Syria  however  remains an open sore unlike the others  Mrs  Clinton not only argued for more aggressive policy while in office  but is now looking ahead 15 months  anticipating that  if she wins the presidency  she will inherit the mess in the Middle East  Mr  Obama has said he expects to pass to his successor the war against the Islamic State terrorist group occupying parts of Syria and Iraq Mrs  Clinton made her frustration with the current approach clear on Thursday in interviews with Boston television stations  “I personally would be advocating now for a no fly zone and humanitarian corridors to try to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air ” she told WHDH TV The White House has rejected a no fly zone for years and repeated its position this week  “It raises a whole set of logistical questions about how exactly — what would be enforced  what sort of resources would be used to actually protect that area ” said Josh Earnest  the White House press secretary  “So that’s why  at this point  we’ve indicated that that’s not something that we’re considering right now ”At a news conference at the White House on Friday  Mr  Obama complained that critics of his Syria policy had no viable alternatives  just “half baked ideas” that amounted to “a bunch of mumbo jumbo ” Asked if that included Mrs  Clinton  he tried to avoid tagging her with that label  but dismissed what he called campaign rhetoric “Hillary Clinton is not half baked in terms of her approach to these problems ” Mr  Obama said  “She was  obviously  my secretary of state  But I also think that there’s a difference between running for president and being president  and the decisions that are being made and the discussions that I’m having with the Joint Chiefs become much more specific and require  I think  a different kind of judgment ”He denied that he meant she should know better  but then emphasized again that she is now a candidate  “I think Hillary Clinton would be the first to say that when you’re sitting in the seat that I’m sitting in  in the Situation Room  things look a little bit different — because she’s been right there next to me ” he said Denying that Mrs  Clinton’s position was a campaign ploy  Nick Merrill  her spokesman  said on Saturday that she discussed a no fly zone with allies when she was in office and saw it as part of a broader strategy  “As the president said yesterday  she was there in the Situation Room with him and knows these are hard choices ” he said As secretary  she was there next to Mr  Obama and offered a different prescription then as well  long before she was a candidate  As secretary  she joined with David H  Petraeus  then the C I A  director  and Leon E  Panetta  then the defense secretary  to push a plan to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels Mr  Obama rejected the idea and did not change his mind until later  when he authorized a limited assistance program by the C I A  By the time he finally came around last year and began a military program to train Syrian opposition forces  it turned out badly  By the Pentagon’s own account  just four or five American trained rebels are in the fight White House officials said that the result showed the idea was never a good one  and that critics — Mrs  Clinton presumably included  even if not explicitly named — should admit that it was never a panacea Critics said Mr  Obama waited too long  until rebels who were open to working with the Americans had given up and allied themselves with radical groups  Moreover  they said the program was fundamentally flawed from the start because it would require rebels to fight only the Islamic State and not the forces of President Bashar al Assad  whom they want to topple  Mr  Obama and Mrs  Clinton are left in the awkward position of disagreeing and having different priorities for the moment  The president wants to defend his policy and deflect blame for a four year old civil war that has ravaged a country  His former secretary of state wants to show what she would do differently  And Republicans pounce at any sign of disagreement  “Ouch ” a Republican statement said after Mr  Obama “brushed back” Mrs  Clinton on Friday Mrs  Clinton has made clear her disagreements about Syria before  Last year  she lamented the failure to build a credible opposition force against Mr  Assad  “The failure to do that left a big vacuum  which the jihadists have now filled ” she told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic  More broadly  she assailed Mr  Obama’s cautious approach to foreign policy  “ ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle ” she said  She and Mr  Obama later papered over the dispute by “hugging it out ” as a Clinton aide put it at the time  when both were visiting Martha’s Vineyard  But for all the hugging  the difference of opinion remained ","headline":{"main":"Syria Exposes Split Between Obama and Clinton","content_kicker":"News Analysis","kicker":"News Analysis","print_headline":"Syria

was a summer Friday night in Iowa  and a high school auditorium here was overflowing  as more than 1 000 people  holding signs and collecting names  spilled out into the lobby and onto the sidewalk  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont strolled onstage — tieless  his white hair askew  his shoulders stooped — and stopped at the sight in front of him “What this campaign is doing is sending a loud and clear message to the billionaire class  And that is that their greed is destroying the United States of America ” Mr  Sanders  a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination  shouted above the roar of the crowd  “This country belongs to all of us — and not just a handful of billionaires ”To many in this state with the first nominating contest of 2016  it was a familiar scene  a candidate from Vermont challenging the Democratic Party status quo with a lusty if slightly cantankerous presentation — and drawing huge crowds  In 2004  it was Howard Dean  the doctor and former governor of Vermont  who commanded his party’s attention with booming rallies and displays of populist passion  this summer  it is Mr  Sanders  a candidate with a similar pedigree who seems to be playing off a similar script Yet for all the obvious similarities  there are striking differences between the two — in their campaign appeals  ideologies and skills as candidates — which may go far in determining whether Mr  Sanders follows Mr  Dean’s trajectory  a once hot comet who quickly burns out after Iowa Both men are New York natives who live in Burlington  Vt   they avoid talk of themselves or their biographies  and display irritation with many of the conventions of the way campaigns are conducted and covered  Both call for universal health care  though the appeal has less resonance now than it did before the Affordable Care Act was passed  Both have seemed to strike a chord that suggests impatience with the more establishment Democrats in the contest  whether Hillary Rodham Clinton today or John Kerry and John Edwards  senators from Massachusetts and North Carolina  in 2004 And both have drawn fervent crowds who embrace their philosophy and celebrate their candidate as fighter styles “He is telling the truth  and not giving political speeches ” said Gwen Harvey  67  a retired insurance manager who saw him speak here  Maggie Rawland  86  a self described Democratic activist who said she has been attending political rallies in Iowa for 40 years  said Mr  Sanders was “firing up audiences — and better than Dean did ”“He’s saying what we are hoping the big majority of people are saying ” she added  “that the money in politics has gone too far ”Still  what may prove more significant  as Democrats begin to focus on the choice ahead of them and attention shifts from the Republican contest after last week’s debate  are the ways in which the two liberals from Vermont are different For Mr  Dean  a defining issue was his opposition to the war in Iraq as he seized on the overriding concern of many Democratic primary voters to distinguish himself from Mr  Edwards and Mr  Kerry  By contrast  Mr  Sanders can speak for 60 minutes without once mentioning foreign policy  his animating issues are economic inequality and the corrupting influence of money in politics Mr  Dean was  at 55  a kinetic live wire of a candidate  plunging into his first national campaign after 22 years in Vermont politics  Mr  Sanders  73  is  at least in comparison  the measured if stern family uncle  an independent who for all his association with the progressive politics of Burlington shows the command of policy that comes with being a product of Washington  where he has served since 1991 Mr  Dean was wary of people who tried to paint him as being too far to the left  Mr  Sanders is a self described socialist  and that political philosophy is celebrated in campaign speeches that  while in some ways reminiscent of Mr  Dean’s appeals  seem to take them one step further  “The only way we are going to transform America is to develop a strong grass roots movement that I call a revolution ” he told members of Netroots Nation  an organization of liberal activists  at its convention in Phoenix in July  “We need a mass movement of the American people to say enough is enough ”And in an age of unforgiving news and social media  Mr  Sanders has so far displayed a discipline on the campaign trail that often eluded Mr  Dean  The former governor was prone  in all his exuberance  to self destructive missteps and bursts of anger  He had to apologize for asserting that Mr  Edwards had been deceptive about voting for the Iraq war resolution  he had not   then apologize again after coming under fire from his rivals for declaring that he wanted to be the “the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks ”Mr  Dean’s campaign was undone  as much as anything  by the release of videotapes of public television appearances in Vermont in which he had disparaged the Iowa caucuses “Their personalities are just so different ” said Deborah Marlin  50  who showed up for Mr  Sanders’s rally here and recalled seeing Mr  Dean around Iowa in 2004  a year in which she ended up supporting George W  Bush  “I think Bernie is much more of a people person ”The two may call the same quiet Vermont community home  and Mr  Sanders was the mayor of Burlington while Mr  Dean represented the community in the Vermont House of Representatives  but they are not close  Mr  Sanders said the last time he spoke to Mr  Dean was “when I bumped into him a year ago ” He did not endorse Mr  Dean in 2004  Mr  Dean  who has endorsed Mrs  Clinton in this contest  did not return telephone calls or emails seeking comment for this article “I’ve known Howard Dean for decades ” Mr  Sanders said over hot tea at a Thai restaurant in Phoenix recently  when the temperature outside was 97 degrees  “I like Howard Dean  Our politics are different  What Howard did in his race was brilliantly seize on the issue of the war in Iraq and the fact that Democrats didn’t have the courage to say what had to be said ”“In terms of Dean’s politics and mine  they are different ” he said  “I look at issues much more from a class based perspective than he does  He did health care stuff  My perspective is a little bit different  I say we do need a political revolution ”The differences go beyond the two men Mr  Dean  in 2004  broke out of a fractured pack of Democrats and took command of the contest  Mr  Sanders has  essentially  one strong opponent  Mrs  Clinton  and a longer shot rival  Martin O’Malley  the former Maryland governor “I understand why people are making the comparisons ” said Joe Trippi  a Democratic consultant who managed Mr  Dean’s campaign  “But in a lot of ways Sanders is not as strong as Dean was  We coalesced the left and the progressives  with a split field ”“One problem Sanders has is  yes  there were Democrats in the party who believed Dean was unelectable ” Mr  Trippi said  “But it’s a much smaller proportion of Democrats than today who think Sanders is unelectable  There is almost a pervasive sense of  he is never going to be president  That makes it much harder for him ”And while there are similarities in the crowds both men draw — overwhelmingly white  for the most part liberal activists — this is not the Democratic Party Mr  Dean was seeking to lead in 2004  The party is younger and more ethnically diverse now  in a way that Mr  Sanders’s crowds are not  The liberal wing of the party  or what Mr  Dean liked to call the “Democratic wing of the Democratic Party ” has undergone its own maturation over the years  its ambitions readjusted after it watched Mr  Dean lose and President Obama turn out to be something short of an unfaltering ideological ally “Sanders gives me a sense of déjà vu  not just the level of excitement that he generates among people who desperately want an alternative to the establishment status quo  but also the irrational cherry picking of news to convince themselves that victory is just around the corner ” said Markos Moulitsas  the founder of the liberal blog Daily Kos and the organizer of the first Netroots Nation convention  as it came to be known “I was knee deep in the Dean movement  so I remember those big exciting crowds  but I also remember ignoring the fact that they were almost exclusively made up of young  white  fairly affluent and educated people ” Mr  Moulitsas said  “And Sanders’s are no different  ill reflecting a modern Democratic Party that is at least 40 percent minority and overwhelmingly female ”In Seattle on Saturday  Mr  Sanders was confronted by protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement who climbed onstage and demanded an opportunity to talk about police brutality and to note the anniversary of the fatal shooting by a white police officer of Michael Brown  an unarmed 18 year old black man  in Ferguson  Mo  Mr  Sanders stepped aside and finally left the event without addressing the crowd Yet Mr  Sanders’s appeal shows no sign of fading  And in a sign of self confidence — and a tribute to Mr  Dean’s signature argument  when he was chairman of the Democratic National Committee  that the party had to compete in all 50 states — Mr  Sanders is campaigning in such unlikely Democratic states as Louisiana and Texas  It appears to be working  He walked out to a rally in Arizona to find 11 000 people waiting to hear him on a Saturday night “We have had large turnouts in Wisconsin and Colorado ” proclaimed Mr  Sanders  gazing at the crowd  “But this is the largest turnout ”He waited for the cheering to die down  and as he began to speak  his words seemed to echo the other Vermont politician who walked the path he is on today “Somebody told me that people are giving up on the political process ” Mr  Sanders said  “Not that I’m seeing tonight  Your incredible presence here tonight gives people all over this country hope that when we stand together  when we come together in meetings like this  there is nothing that we cannot accomplish in transforming America ”","headline":{"main":"Similarities

told the media website Rare that he would be “the first presidential candidate to live stream an entire day on the campaign trail ”—  As campaign filing deadlines add pressure to Mr  Biden  his public schedule does little to clarify whether he has designs on a last minute entrance into the race and the debate  Though he is listed as having a briefing in the morning and meetings at the White House in the afternoon  his evening  it seems  is clear — And with new fund raising figures due to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday  many campaigns in the last few weeks have been eager to offer reporters a preview of their robust fund raising hauls  But one of the biggest names in the Republican field — Jeb Bush — has been silent about his  fund raising Analysts say that could signal a disappointing fund raising quarter for Mr  Bush  whose support has fallen into single digits in many national polls  or it could simply indicate that Mr  Bush is holding his cards close to his vest   His campaign declined to say on Monday when it might release its numbers  Mr  Bush set a torrid pace in June by raising more than  11 million in his first two weeks of campaign fund raising — and  100 million more raised through unlimited contributions to a “super PAC” supporting his campaign He may be hard pressed to match that pace in the coming figures  which cover the period from July 1 to Sept  30 One of his rivals  Ben Carson  set a high bar for the Republican field  reporting at the end of September that his campaign had raised  20 2 million for the quarter An email last month from Mr  Bush’s finance director  Heather Larrison  asking potential supporters to pitch in as little as  1 before the Sept  30 deadline  struck an urgent tone  calling it “our biggest fund raising deadline yet ”The email said the campaign was seeking to reach 10 000 new donors by the end of the quarter  “It’s critical that we have the resources to win ” Ms  Larrison wrote Supporters will know any day

shooting in Oregon  Mr  Obama lamented that the country’s response to mass killings had become routine Now  a new group of gun control activists has seized on the word in the hopes of adding to the pressure on policy makers for new firearms measures  The group  called A New Routine for America  is organizing a rally in front of the White House on Saturday at 10 a m  to demonstrate its resolve The group joins a long list of organizations  many of them similarly formed in the wake of a shooting  There is Moms Demand Action  formed after the school shooting in Newtown  Conn   in which 20 children were killed  There is Americans for Responsible Solutions  the group that Gabrielle Giffords  the former Arizona congresswoman  started after she was shot  And there is the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence  a collection of 47 national organizations But Faith Elizabeth Grant  the founder of Routine  says there is room for more  She has asked many of the other groups to encourage their membership to attend the White House rally  and she hopes the show of support for new gun control measures can be a kind of tipping point in the stalled Washington debate “Americans are tired of what I call the ‘gun rights versus gun wrong’ debate ” Ms  Grant said  “We believe there are millions of Americans out there who aren’t engaged in this conversation but want to be  They just don’t want to

activist wing and the donor class of the Democratic Party like the regulation of Wall Street The desire to assail too big to fail banks energizes the left and has propelled Senator Elizabeth Warren and the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders  But some of the party’s most prodigious donors come from the financial industry and don’t much care for its vilification  And Bill Clinton’s administration oversaw the deregulation on Wall Street All that makes the question of how Hillary Clinton would regulate the financial sector a crucial test of her campaign to win the Democratic nomination  With a plan she released Thursday  we got a first glimpse of how she would walk that balance beam The short version  Directionally  Mrs  Clinton favors more intensive regulation of Wall Street than what is in place now  Bank executives and lobbyists will find little to like in her plan  But her approach stops short of the wholesale breakup of too big to fail banks favored by Mr  Sanders and Mrs  Warren  She would prefer instead to take the philosophical approach embodied in the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform act a few steps further Mrs  Clinton proposes changes that would put stiff new costs on the largest banks and give regulators greater power to break up an institution they view as too sprawling and risky  But her plan does not envision a return to the era of the Glass Steagall Act  the 1930s law requiring commercial banking and investment banking to remain separate  It was reversed by Congress during the Bill Clinton administration  an action that had less to do with the global financial crisis than many liberal activists would suggest  Rather  her plan focuses on a series of changes to incentivize the biggest banks to shrink and simplify  It looks to reform markets that may be obscure to the general public but were actually key nodes in the 2008 global financial crisis  In particular  it concentrates on the multi trillion dollar securities lending and repurchase market  which is a crucial piece of the world’s financial plumbing The Dodd Frank law gave regulators a broad range of powers to oversee “systemically important” institutions  Combined with new international capital rules and more aggressive enforcement of corporate lawbreaking  it has made it more expensive than ever to be a sprawling global megabank  Giant banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were left to decide on their own whether to respond to those costs by slimming down  such as by selling or shutting down business units If Mrs  Clinton is elected president and gets her way — some of her ideas could be executed through regulatory fiat  others would require legislation — the incentive to slim down would be that much greater Here are the key elements of her plan A new “risk fee” on the largest financial firms  The biggest banks  insurers and other mega financial firms already face greater oversight than their smaller rivals under the Dodd Frank Act  Mrs  Clinton proposes taking that notion a step further by requiring a significant new fee  payable to the United States Treasury  for those very large firms that are potentially risky  Interestingly  its level is not determined by the size of a firm per se  but by the amount it relies upon volatile short term funding to finance its operations So  for example  Wells Fargo has about twice the assets of Goldman Sachs  but primarily funds itself with bank deposits and engages in relatively plain consumer and business lending  A more complex firm like Goldman  which relies more heavily on fast moving capital markets for funding  would thus have more to fear from the risk fee Mrs  Clinton’s proposal does not detail the exact scale or structure of the fee  which would require legislation  She envisions it as being substantial enough to have a meaningful impact on banks’ decision making  In other words  billions  not millions  of dollars Give regulators more power to break up financial firms  For all the discussion of whether to break up the too big to fail banks in recent years  the actual legal tools that regulators have to do so are limited  Mrs  Clinton proposes granting regulators more explicit power to demand a firm downsize or break up  A campaign fact sheet adds that Mrs  Clinton “would appoint regulators who would both use these new authorities and the substantial authorities they already have to hold firms accountable ”Dodd Frank requires that major banks prepare “living wills” that describe the legal details of how they would be unwound in the event of a failure  But this proposed legislation would instead grant regulators more power to determine that  for example  a bank that had repeated major ethics scandals might just be too sprawling and complex to manage and therefore could endanger financial stability Regulate “shadow banking” more intensively  While the public debate about financial reform has concentrated on the too big to fail banks  in many ways a bigger driver of the 2008 financial crisis was the “shadow banking” sector — segments of the financial system that resemble banks in important ways but are not regulated like them  It includes money market mutual funds  hedge funds and some parts of the insurance industry Her plans for addressing risks in those segments of the shadow banking system are still relatively vague  but she has more specifics on the securities lending and repurchase system  which was a key channel through which the failure of Lehman Brothers and near failure of the insurer A I G  endangered the global financial system in 2008 Mrs  Clinton calls for new international rules governing disclosure  margin and collateral requirements to try to make a failure of one global bank or insurer less likely to endanger the entire world economy  These are changes that are likely to take place through regulatory action rather than legislation With the first Democratic debate taking place next week  the stage is set for financial reform to be a major area where Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders can clash ","headline":{"main":"How Hillary Clinton Would Regulate Wall

private email system as secretary of state Mr  Forbes said he did not think she laid the questions to rest  But he was in a minority  Most debate watchers said the highlight of the night was Mr  Sanders’s saying “the American people are sick and tired” of the issue of Mrs  Clinton’s “damn emails ”Mrs  Clinton satisfied questions about trustworthiness when she noted that President Obama had trusted her enough to pick her to run the State Department  said Becky Schmitz  a social worker in Jefferson County  Before the debate  she leaned toward Mrs  Clinton but had doubts  Afterward  the doubts were gone  “She strengthened my position towards her ” Ms  Schmitz said  “She was very poised and strong  and I thought she carried the debate ”That was a sentiment shared even by Democrats who did not come away supporting Mrs  Clinton “I’d love to be a Hillary girl because I’d love to see a female president ” said Peggy Sherrets  the mayor of Oelwein  population 6 400  in northeast Iowa  “I’m just not sure she’s electable  I’m wondering if her time hasn’t passed ”Ms  Sherrets  too  seemed impressed with Mr  O’Malley  especially his statement that he had infuriated the National Rifle Association with gun control measures he passed as governor  “I grew up with guns and believe in the Second Amendment  but it’s gotten out of hand ” she said  “It’s gotten very scary  even in small towns ”Mrs  Clinton’s strong performance caused supporters of Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  to worry he has hesitated too long to enter the race  “I’ve kind of given up hope ” said Dean Lane  a farmer in Newton  who believes Mr  Biden would have an easier time winning a general election than Mrs  Clinton  who will continue to ignite Republican fury  “He would have had an easier time if he’d gotten in a month ago ”Mary Bruner  who runs human resources for her family owned bank in Carroll  approached the debate as if it were a job interview “I love Bernie’s passion and I love almost all of his positions ” she said  But she thought Mrs  Clinton offered the more “stellar résumé” and showed she had “people skills” needed for the presidency  “What was impressive was when another candidate was talking  she listened to them ” she said  “I thought she was genuine  I thought she was prepared ”Some voters who were unexpectedly impressed with Mr  O’Malley said he would be a better second choice candidate if somehow Mrs  Clinton stumbles  “Before  he had seemed milquetoast to me ” said Cal Tormey  a writer who works as a waiter in Des Moines  “I was impressed by how strong he came across ” But he still plans to caucus for Mrs  Clinton  whom he supported in 2008  “I’m trying to bet on the horse that I think will win ” he said Ben Nesselhuf  the vice president for development at an addiction treatment program in Sioux City  said he was still undecided after watching the debate “For Hillary Clinton  the bar was set high  and she went over it by a lot ” he said  “She’s had a rough six months with the Republicans zeroing in on her  and that’s taken a toll  I thought she was great last night ”A former chairman of South Dakota’s Democratic Party who moved to Iowa recently  Mr  Nesselhuf said that Mr  Sanders did “a good job introducing himself and his philosophy to a wider audience ” and that Mr  O’Malley “proved he belonged” in the race  As for the two other candidates on the stage  Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee  Mr  Nesselhuf said they were out of their league and “don’t belong on the stage ”Sarah and Bryan Vanderpool  professional folks singers who recently moved from Los Angeles  began the debate as Sanders supporters  Mr  Vanderpool was still one afterward  “He really spoke to the issues and I’m really excited about him ” he said But Ms  Vanderpool found herself unexpectedly drawn to the gravitational field of Mrs  Clinton  “I came in really  really supporting Bernie  and now I like them both ” she said  “She really handled herself well  she has a history of working on the stuff she’s going to be dealing with if she’s president ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Wins Iowa Fans With Debate Performance","print_headline":"Clinton Wins Iowa

morning  Before telling a large crowd in Iowa that “the Summer of Trump” had been great for his ego  Donald J  Trump got into a heated exchange with a journalist from a Spanish language network  adding to a season of early twists and surprises in both parties  And another could be in the works as Mr  Trump might have to soon move over to make room in the spotlight Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democratic presidential contenders are set to address the party’s summer meeting in Minneapolis this week  but Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  is getting ahead of the game even if he won’t be on hand As he ponders a possible presidential candidacy  Mr  Biden has invited hundreds of members of the Democratic National Committee to a conference call Wednesday afternoon as he discusses provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran The call is an opportunity for Mr  Biden to emphasize his role in the Obama administration and to show off his foreign policy chops while keeping his name in the presidential conversation with committee members whose personal support and political networks could be crucial to winning the nomination as well as the general election Two members who received the invitation said they took it as a sign that  at the least  he wants to make sure he is on the committee’s radar before it hears from the current field  His decision is expected this summer Supporters of Mr  Biden will also be a force at the Minneapolis meeting  where  according to an email to party members from Draft Biden  a group encouraging Mr  Biden to run  four informal briefings will be held  Joshua Alcorn  senior adviser to Draft Biden  wrote in the email that he “wanted to share with you Draft Biden’s thoughts on the 2016 Democratic Primary ” according to a copy that was shared with The Times “All we ask is that you keep an open mind and consider Joe Biden ” Mr  Alcorn wrote Mr  Biden wasn’t the only one emphasizing his links to the administration  Mrs  Clinton  the former secretary of state  on Tuesday held up her endorsement by Tom Vilsack  the agriculture secretary  The news release didn’t make much of that job however  instead noting repeatedly that Mr  Vilsack was a former governor of Iowa — Carl HulseStay tuned throughout the day  Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates President Obama will participate in another segment of his “Live From the White House” interviews with anchors from several markets  His aides say he will discuss the nuclear deal with Iran and his planned trip on Thursday to New Orleans to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina Martin O’Malley‘s campaign will participate in 30 house parties throughout Iowa  with the candidate calling in to each  A nationwide house party by Mr  Sanders last month drew over 100 000 attendees Jeb Bush will hold a town hall in Pensacola  Fla   and his campaign will be opening its Nevada office in Las Vegas Mr  Trump has put in place a robust field operation in Iowa  but converting raucous crowds into votes remains a challenge An email exchange gives insight into Mr  Bush’s thinking about same sex marriage during his time as governor of Florida And by refusing support from “super PACs ” Mr  Sanders has built a campaign that appears to be drawing even more rank and file support than Mr  Obama did in 2008 Many Spanish language news outlets no longer pretend to objectively cover Mr  Trump after his disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey held a news conference urging Senator Cory Booker to oppose the Iran nuclear deal With a financial crisis in China rattling global markets  and drawing the attention of other Republican candidates  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida plans to deliver a major foreign policy speech outlining how a Rubio administration would more assertively challenge the Chinese And in his arguments with Mr  Trump over immigration  Mr  Bush offered some clear distinctions while also angering Asian Americans as he sought to soothe feelings among Hispanics for his previous use of the term “anchor baby ”Mr  Trump is huge in the Spanish language news media — but not always in a good way First Draft asked two nonpartisan media analytics companies — Crimson Hexagon and Two 42 Solutions — to crunch the numbers on how Mr  Trump is covered in the Spanish language news media in comparison with the English language news media  And some trends emerged Looking at online news  forums and blogs  Crimson Hexagon found that coverage of Mr  Trump more frequently was tied to immigration in the Spanish news media  56 5 percent of the time  than in the English news media  18 46 percent   The company also found that he was covered more negatively in the Spanish language news media  69 percent negative mentions  than in the English language news media  58 percent  “The conversation was more negative than positive in general  particularly in blogs and forums  in both languages ” said Chris Bingham  the chief technology officer of Crimson Hexagon Two 42 Solutions  which also found that Mr  Trump was covered more critically in the Spanish language media  noticed another interesting trend in both English and Spanish news media  “Right now  the more bad things you say about Trump  the more likely your article is to go viral ” said Mohammad Hamid  a co founder and chief technology officer of Two 42 Solutions — Ashley ParkerReferring to Black Lives Matter protesters who have interrupted candidates at several appearances  The Los Angeles Times says  “This election has put White House hopefuls in the unusual position of defending themselves even to apparent allies ”Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is courting

spirited challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire  Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has reminded her supporters that she will be better positioned to defeat Mr  Sanders once the primary fight moves to more racially diverse states  where polls show she has a large advantage over him among blacks and Hispanics But a late entry by Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  into the Democratic contest could complicate Mrs  Clinton’s strategy  particularly if he were able to portray himself to minority voters as President Obama’s rightful heir There may be no more consequential element to a campaign by Mr  Biden  If he were able to loosen Mrs  Clinton’s grip on nonwhite voters by the time votes are cast in South Carolina  Nevada and the Southern states holding contests on Super Tuesday  it could set off a prolonged  bruising and expensive Democratic primary season But interviews with Democratic strategists and elected officials  as well as polls of Democrats  suggest that it would not be easy for Mr  Biden to poach blacks and Hispanics from Mrs  Clinton  who  along with former President Bill Clinton  remains highly popular with those voters To do so  these Democrats say  Mr  Biden would need a measure of help — or simply luck  Mrs  Clinton would have to be seen as politically damaged for minority voters  and especially black and Hispanic women  to switch their loyalties from a potential first female president to a white man “If she acquits herself well on Oct  22 and she does well in Iowa  I don’t think Vice President Biden getting in will be a big factor ” said Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  referring to the date for Mrs  Clinton’s testimony before the House panel investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state  “But if something happens with these emails or she stumbles in Iowa  then it’s ‘Katy  bar the door ’ ”Other prominent black Democrats questioned how much harm the email controversy could cause Mrs  Clinton “Black people are used to being attacked themselves ” said Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  who said his constituents were more focused on economic opportunity and racial justice — or what he called “survival stuff ” Mr  Biden  he added  “only becomes significant if they see that she is faltering ”Polls show that Mr  Biden would probably compete for the same pool of Democratic voters as Mrs  Clinton  But he would not begin with significant support from minorities  A New York Times CBS News Poll taken last month showed Mrs  Clinton with support from 52 percent of nonwhite voters  compared with 18 percent for Mr  Biden and 17 percent for Mr  Sanders In his 2008 primary contest with Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Obama struggled at first to dislodge black voters from their attachment to her family  But once he prevailed in Iowa and blacks realized that he could be a winner  they rushed in his direction  eager to make history  In South Carolina  Mr  Obama gained a crucial upper hand by winning with a 28 point margin and crushing Mrs  Clinton among blacks Mr  Biden’s supporters in South Carolina say that the vice president has since become closely identified with Mr  Obama  “He is almost the face of the administration around here ” said the Rev  Joseph Darby  an influential African Methodist Episcopal pastor in Charleston  “The president has only made a few trips to South Carolina  but Joe is in and out all the time ”Mr  Darby said Mrs  Clinton still retained support but had failed to generate much enthusiasm  “The challenge is not just support  but energy ” he said Mrs  Clinton’s supporters question whether President Obama’s popularity is transferable to Mr  Biden  and pointedly note that Mr  Biden has a separate identity  and record “The problem Joe Biden has is that Joe Biden is not Barack Obama ” said Bakari Sellers  a former South Carolina state representative who is backing Mrs  Clinton  “We have to have a conversation about mass incarceration ” he said  “And when the vice president was senator  he was the reason so many African Americans were sent to prison  and are still there right now  for minor offenses  That’s a conversation we have to have  And I’m not sure he wants to go through that ”A spokeswoman for Mr  Biden  who insisted on anonymity to discuss campaign related questions  said Mr  Biden had believed since the 1994 crime bill’s passage — it was signed into law by President Bill Clinton — that aspects of it  “like the three strikes measure ” would not “function as their proponents intended ” Other elements  “like relief from mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent  first time drug offenders ” she said  “didn’t go as far as he would have liked to improve the then existing law and protect basic principles of fairness and justice ”In Nevada  where Mrs  Clinton dominated among Latino voters in the 2008 caucuses  Democrats say she has helped herself by aggressively organizing and by recruiting Hispanic leaders  But Mr  Biden has been a familiar face there as well  and Democratic officials there suggest that Mr  Biden would at least challenge Mrs  Clinton in minority constituencies that Mr  Sanders has so far been unable to reach “If Biden gets in  it’s going to make the decision making process more difficult for people ” said Lucy Flores  a former member of the Nevada State Assembly who is running for Congress next year  “They’ll feel like they have more options ”Mrs  Clinton’s supporters argue that her campaign has made minority voters a vital focus and that Hispanics  especially  have noticed  “They made it very clear that they understand that we’re appealing to a diverse state and that Latinos are going to play a key role here ” said Andres Ramirez  a strategist in Las Vegas  who noted that Mrs  Clinton’s first two Nevada hires were Hispanics and that she gave her first major campaign speech about immigration in the state “Ethnic outreach is often considered a secondary priority of campaigns ” Mr  Ramirez said  “but when Hillary launched her campaign  she made it a primary concern ”Democrats not committed to any candidate say that Mr  Biden faces the possibility of a window closing because of the organizational demands of the Nevada caucuses “Does he have demonstrated successes in the Obama administration? Yes ” former Representative Steven Horsford said of Mr  Biden  “But time is running out  As he takes painstaking steps to decide  others are making the necessary inroads ”","headline":{"main":"Biden Bid Could Lead to Battle for Minorities","print_headline":"Biden Bid Could Lead to Battle for Minorities"},"wordCount":"1069"},

on Wednesday and directly into a hotbed of speculation about his political future The speech he came to deliver — about the need to invest in an educated work force  provide two years of free college education and align college offerings with employer needs — was boilerplate stuff  He said much the same at colleges in Denver in July and Des Moines in February But none of those addresses received anywhere near the attention of his appearance at Miami Dade College The back of the auditorium at the college’s science center was bristling with more than 20 television cameras  Most of the nation’s major news media organizations covered the event  The British Embassy in Washington even sent an observer “Look at all the press here ” Mr  Biden said  gesturing toward the cameras  “It’s amazing their interest in community colleges  and I hope that’s what they’re going to write about ”At least two reporters shouted questions at him about his plans for the 2016 campaign  He ignored them  providing no clues as to whether he will decide to become a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination  Instead  he took off his coat — the large crowd and camera equipment had overwhelmed the room’s air conditioning — and dug into his education speech “People who aren’t willing to risk failure never succeed ” Mr  Biden said  a frequent exhortation to students that seemed to have new resonance Besides the speech  Mr  Biden also attended a  10 000 a couple fund raising dinner to benefit the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  On Thursday  he will focus on selling the nuclear deal with Iran  first at a Jewish community center here and then in a speech at a synagogue in Atlanta His advisers have been silent about whether the trip to South Florida  one of the richest grounds in the country for raising campaign cash  is intended to pave the way for a presidential run The fund raiser was held at the home of Stephen H  Bittel  a prominent commercial real estate developer who raised more than  200 000 for President Obama’s re election Aides to the vice president said that Mr  Biden did not discuss his presidential plans at the dinner  He spoke to the crowd for about 10 minutes  saying that Senator Bernie Sanders was doing a great job exciting crowds  but that “I’m not a populist like Bernie ” Mr  Biden did not mention Hillary Rodham Clinton He then took one question  which was about the Iran deal James Carville  a longtime Democratic political consultant  said that while he did not know if Mr  Biden was going to run  “I wouldn’t read a lot into the tea leaves from him going to South Florida — that’s a regular stop on the itinerary of any senior Democratic politician ”Still  while Mr  Biden has traveled to South Florida more than 30 times since taking office in 2009  an aide said  this trip was different given the focus on his future On Tuesday  Senator Chris Coons  Democrat of Delaware  held a news conference to announce his support for the Iran nuclear deal — a crucial endorsement for the White House  But Mr  Coons then said that he would support Mr  Biden for president  a statement that received almost as much attention as his backing of the Iran deal In early August  Mr  Biden’s confidants said that the vice president intended to decide by early September whether to run  In more recent conversations  advisers have let the deadline slip  with some saying that the first week in October is more likely and others saying that he could wait until early next year The longer he waits  the more difficulties Mr  Biden would face in putting together a successful campaign  The first Democratic presidential debate is scheduled for Oct  13  and some states require that candidates qualify by early November to be placed on primary ballots  The Iowa caucuses will be held in February Joe Trippi  a longtime Democratic operative  said Mr  Biden would undoubtedly ask a few of the wealthy donors he was meeting with on Wednesday about his chances  “I think every time he goes out and does any kind of engagements now  he’s gauging the reaction and seeing how people respond to him ” Mr  Trippi said “I still don’t see a pathway that makes it likely that he wins the nomination  though ” he added A “Draft Biden” movement is underway  and some of the vice president’s advisers have been exploring how to put together enough money for a campaign But Mr  Biden is still reeling from the death of his son Beau three months ago  and he said on a conference call last week that he was uncertain if his family had the “emotional fuel” for another presidential campaign One of Beau Biden’s dying requests was that his father become a candidate  but if Mr  Biden follows his son’s wish  many of his longtime friends and supporters worry that such a quixotic effort could bruise his legacy ","headline":{"main":"Biden Trip to Florida Raises Speculation About Presidential Run","print_headline":"An Electric Visit to a Campaign Fund Haven for

this year  The electorate is in an anti establishment mood  and as a longtime insider  Biden  I argued  would suffer from the same disadvantages Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are now enduring  without any of their advantages  It would end badly But then came Biden’s moment with Stephen Colbert  His discussion of his own grief over his son Beau’s death was beautiful and genuine and revealed the golden heart that everybody knows is at the core of the man Biden talked about Beau  “My son was better than me  And he was better than me in almost every way ” He gestured toward how fluid grief is  how it goes round and round  hides for a few hours and then suddenly overwhelms  But there was something else embedded in that Colbert moment  a formation story Every presidential candidate needs a narrative to explain how his or her character was formed  They need a story line that begins outside of politics with some experience or life defining crucible moment that then defines the nature of their public service Candidates like John F  Kennedy and John McCain were formed by war  Candidates like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were formed by their rise from broken homes and their dedication to lift others and heal divisions  Without a clear formation story  a candidate is just a hodgepodge of positions and logos Democrats this year are looking for a formation story that proves commitment  This is a party that is moving boldly leftward  Its voters want to know their candidate has the inner drive to push through structural changes  not just half measures Bernie Sanders has such a story  From his days at the University of Chicago onward  he has been a pile driver for progressive causes  regardless of the prevailing winds  Hillary Clinton hasn’t yet presented a clear formation story  She talks about being a grandmother  which humanizes her  but doesn’t explain how she got to be the person she is With Colbert  one saw the kernel of a Biden formation story that could connect not only with Democratic voters but with other voters as well  It is a story of dual loss  his wife and daughter decades ago and his son this year  Out of that loss comes a great empathy  a connection to those who are suffering in this economy and this world  Out of that loss comes a hypercharged sense of mission  Out of that loss comes a liberation from the fear of failure that dogs most politicians  and causes them to dodge  prevaricate and spin People who have suffered a loss often want to connect their tragedy to some larger redemptive mission  Biden could plausibly and genuinely emerge sadder but more empathetic and more driven  That would be not only a natural reaction  but also the basis for a compelling campaign  Biden would then benefit from the greater verbal self discipline he has developed while vice president and from the fact that this year  as Donald Trump proves  voters seem tolerant of free talkers Democratic voters aren’t the only ones looking for a strong formation story  Republicans are looking for one  too  but the nature of the Republican race is different  If Democrats are arguing over what positions to fight for  Republicans are arguing about how to fight Republican presidential candidates have found that the strongest way to win favor on the stump is to attack the leaders of their party in Congress for being timid and inept  Many Republican voters are alienated from their party’s leadership  They’re looking for a candidate who can lead a mutiny Donald Trump’s mutiny story is pretty clear  In doing business deal after business deal  he mastered the skills needed to take on the morons who are now running the party and the world  Ben Carson’s story is clear  too  Through his faith and through his medical career he developed the purity of heart and the discipline of will required to walk into Washington without being corrupted by the rottenness found there The Republican desire for a mutiny has kept Trump and Carson aloft longer than most people supposed  I still think they will implode  Their followers need them to be the superheroes they are portraying themselves to be  But politics is hard  especially for beginners  and sooner or later they will flounder and look like they’re in over their heads  At that point it’s all over  At that point  a Bush  Rubio  Kasich or Walker will have an opening to tell a different and more positive story On the Democratic side  a Biden run would be more formidable than I thought last month  You need emotion to beat emotion  With Stephen Colbert he revealed a story and suggested a campaign that is moving  compelling and in tune with the moment ","headline":{"main":"The Biden Formation Story","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"The Formation

presidential candidates in both parties  facing stronger than expected challenges from insurgent campaigns  are rapidly losing one of their few remaining advantages in politics  money In the Republican and Democratic primaries alike  upstart candidates shunned by their parties’ major donors are now financially competitive with — and  in some cases  vastly outraising — opponents who have spent months or even years wooing the big name donors and fund raisers who have traditionally dominated the money race The shift is most striking in the Republican contest  where Ben Carson  a retired neurosurgeon  reported raising by far the most cash   20 million  in the three months ending Sept  30  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas raised  12 million  and Carly Fiorina  a former Hewlett Packard executive  raised about  7 million  All of them increased or held steady their average weekly cash intake over the previous quarter By contrast  the two Republicans favored most by the party elite reported substantial declines in fund raising  Former Gov  Jeb Bush of Florida  who raised  11 4 million in the two weeks after his official campaign announcement in June  took in  13 4 million in the next three months  according to his campaign reports  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida raised  6 million  and Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey  4 2 million  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky  a libertarian Republican  raised  2 5 million During the same period  two Republicans with strong ties to the party’s donor elite — Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin and former Gov  Rick Perry of Texas — were forced out of the race for lack of cash Those departures were a stark reminder of the dangers for candidates who rely heavily on “super PACs ” Outside groups have stockpiled tens of millions of dollars on behalf of establishment candidates such as Mr  Bush and Mr  Rubio  most of it destined to be spent on television advertising  But those groups cannot cover the candidates’ core expenses  such as staff salaries  plane tickets  polling and office rent Mr  Cruz and Mr  Carson lead the Republican field in cash on hand for the primary  with about  12 million for Mr  Cruz and  11 million for Mr  Carson  according to filings with the Federal Election Commission  Mr  Bush and Mr  Rubio each appeared to have about  10 million  Mr  Bush also had more than  400 000 in debt The billionaire real estate mogul Donald J  Trump  subsidized by a seemingly endless wave of free news and television coverage  raised about  4 million  including  100 000 of in kind donations to himself  and spent slightly more  The numbers suggest that Mr  Trump is no longer a self funding candidate  but rather is running his campaign like everyone else  with money from his supporters On the Democratic side  Hillary Rodham Clinton  who secured commitments from many of the party’s biggest donors before she even announced her candidacy  barely outraised Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  a self described socialist  bringing in half as much money a week during the three months ending Sept  30 as she had earlier in the campaign  Mrs  Clinton began October with more than  31 million on hand for the primary  compared with about  27 million for Mr  Sanders  Mrs  Clinton also reported more than  647 000 in debt  Mr  Sanders raised more than three quarters of his funds from donors giving less than  200 each  according to his disclosures  and fewer than 300 gave the maximum allowed contribution of  2 700 “The narrative earlier this year about how money matters is being flushed ” said Scott W  Reed  the senior political strategist for the United States Chamber of Commerce  “Six out of 10 primary voters are supporting outsider candidates  A socialist raised  25 million in the same period a libertarian raised  2 5 million — a 10 to 1 surprise fund raising advantage ”The steady fund raising of outsider candidates  who have tapped into a network of smaller donors  suggests a financial paradigm shift in both parties  but particularly on the right  where candidates beloved by the Republicans’ socially conservative and evangelical base have sometimes struggled to muster the financial resources to sustain a long term campaign for the nomination “I think we are in an unprecedented moment in the Republican Party ” said Ed Martin  the president of the Eagle Forum  a conservative grass roots organization  “The conservative wing is ascendant and has figured out how to compete — how to raise the money and build the infrastructure  And I think the establishment has run out of a little steam ”But the shift also reflects insurgent candidates’ successful exploitation of online and small donor fund raising during a period when the dominance of Mr  Trump sowed doubt and uncertainty among the Republican Party’s donor class Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Bush have kept up grueling schedules of fund raisers  with Mr  Bush’s campaign holding at least 58 events over 90 days ending in September  Mr  Cruz’s campaign  by contrast  said that 6 000 of his small contributors had pledged to make recurring donations every month — providing enough cash flow  with no fund raising appearances necessary  to cover Mr  Cruz’s expenses in the first four primary states  as well as in others where the campaign has set up operations “There is tremendous power among these donors ” said John Pudner  a former campaign manager for Representative Dave Brat of Virginia — the conservative who unseated Eric Cantor  then the No  2 Republican in the House  in 2014 — who now heads a conservative group that looks to empower small donors  “I think they’re realizing that they can be a counterbalance  particularly social conservatives ”The reliance on small donors does not always come without a cost  Mr  Carson has relied heavily on expensive direct mail and telemarketing consultants to raise money  driving up his burn rate  Of the  14 million he spent during the third quarter alone  fund raising costs totaled  11 million  according to his campaign  But Mr  Rubio and Mr  Bush spent at an even higher rate   4 of every  5 raised  in the three months ending Sept  30  Mr  Cruz raised most of his small donor money online  according to figures provided by his campaign  suggesting a sustainable financial model for the months ahead Terry Giles  who was Mr  Carson’s campaign manager and now advises super PACs supporting him  said that Mr  Carson and other upstart candidates  including Mr  Sanders on the left  had benefited in their fund raising from public distaste for establishment politicians “Political endorsements mean nothing ” Mr  Giles said  “If anything  they just turn people off  It’s a whole new ballgame ”The insurgents’ rise is likely to make their rivals even more dependent on super PACs and other groups  While super PACs are not required to disclose updated fund raising totals until January  groups backing Mr  Rubio and Mr  Bush have reported raising at least  140 million in unlimited contributions  Mr  Rubio  reflecting his straitened finances  has relied for television advertising on a nonprofit group  Conservative Solutions  which does not disclose its donors Mr  Cruz is the only one of the candidates emphasizing their outsider status who has succeeded in the super PAC realm  Groups backing him have raised at least  38 million   Of that   15 million came from the Wilks family  who earned billions of dollars in the fracking boom and are staunch opponents of abortion and same sex marriage   Mr  Carson is now scrambling to catch up  Advisers to his super PAC held a donor gathering at a Texas ranch last weekend  and Mr  Giles said the group expected large financial commitments in the weeks ahead “You’re going to see significant money coming to Carson’s camp ” he said Robert Borosage  a director of the Campaign for America’s Future  a liberal advocacy group  said that Mr  Sanders’s ability to raise money by positioning himself as an outsider reminded him of President Obama’s 2008 campaign  which received millions of dollars in small contributions He said Mr  Sanders had “capitalized on the fervor of the anti establishment movement ”Noting that Mr  Sanders has renounced super PAC support  Mr  Borosage added that he “will never have as much money as Hillary  but what’s clear is that he will have enough money to be competitive

So I think he’s figuring he’s got another month or so to see what happens  to sort of put feelers out there ”Kendra Barkoff  a spokeswoman for Mr  Biden  declined to comment on questions about calls that have been made and the efforts of the vice president’s allies Members of Mr  Biden’s inner circle have asked the Democrats they have spoken with to be circumspect about conversations  but the advisers have followed who is saying favorable things in the news media about the vice president’s prospects  and are contacting them after they do so Mr  Biden’s allies have also reached out to some gay and lesbian donors  who the vice president’s supporters believe may be open to his candidacy because of his early support for same sex marriage   Mr  Biden spoke out for same sex marriage rights before Mr  Obama or Mrs  Clinton   Those who have been approached include Scott Miller  the husband of Tim Gill  who has been a major backer of caucuses for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people  according to Democrats familiar with the outreach effort  Mr  Gill and Mr  Miller are already supporting Mrs  Clinton  and Mr  Miller is on the board of the pro Clinton group Correct the Record Many of Mrs  Clinton’s backers  while respectful of Mr  Biden  believe that few of her contributors will abandon her  no matter the vice president’s plans “Everybody thinks the world of Joe Biden ” said Jay S  Jacobs  a contributor and former chairman of the New York Democratic Party  “The difficulty that I think he’d face is that not only are almost all or most of the major donors lined up behind Hillary  but I believe they’re enthusiastic in that ”Among the obstacles Mr  Biden would face would be fund raising  He has struggled when methodically calling upon donors Still  his supporters have been cheered by the small donations amassed by Mr  Sanders and have wondered if the vice president could use a similar approach  Only a small group of advisers are in regular contact with Mr  Biden about his deliberations  Outside of his family  he leans mainly on Steve Ricchetti  his chief of staff  Mike Donilon  one of his longest political advisers  and Ted Kaufman  his longtime aide who temporarily took his seat in the Senate when Mr  Biden became vice president Hunter Biden  Mr  Biden’s younger son  has been described by several prominent Democrats as central to his father’s thinking and he has been in touch with some supporters  though he emphasized in an email that he had not “asked anyone to donate to Draft Biden or any other super PAC ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton’s Woes Pushing Joe Biden to Reach Out to Those Who Could Back a Campaign","print_headline":"Clinton’s Woes Pushing Biden to Reach Out"},"wordCount":"1091"},

respect and support Mrs  Clinton’s self assurance  command of issues and ease in parrying Mr  Sanders at the forum in Las Vegas drew praise from Iowa Democrats  who will cast the first nominating votes on Feb  1 Iowans have observed the two leading candidates closely  Mrs  Clinton has spent 22 days campaigning in the state  and Mr  Sanders 20  The former secretary of state holds a narrow lead in most Iowa polls  but Mr  Sanders  a Vermont senator  has cut deeply into the aura of inevitability that surrounded her in the spring “Like a lot of people in Iowa  I was on the fence between Sanders and Clinton ” said Jaime Bernal  who works in accounting for Wells Fargo in Des Moines  “I just needed that little push ”He came away from the debate doubting Mr  Sanders’s ability to work with Republicans in Congress and was encouraged that Mrs  Clinton has the political skills to build bridges  “She’s shown her leadership ” he said A third candidate  Martin O’Malley  a former Maryland governor  was also cited as impressive in interviews with more than a dozen debate watchers who had not previously committed to a candidate “I think we’ll see O’Malley rise in the polls ” said Representative John Forbes  whose state House district is in suburban Des Moines “He just had an issue of breaking out “ he said  “Now the American public has seen him  has seen what type of quality individual he is  He’d do very well serving as our next president ”Mr  Forbes  a pharmacist  attended a debate watch party at a Mexican restaurant in Urbandale  where the shuttered former headquarters of Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin  who quit the Republican race  was a few doors down  Before the debate  he said the big issue for Mrs  Clinton was “character and trust” because of her use of a private email system as secretary of state Mr  Forbes said he did not think she laid the questions to rest  But he was in a minority  Most debate watchers said the highlight of the night was Mr  Sanders’s saying “the American people are sick and tired” of the issue of Mrs  Clinton’s “damn emails ”Mrs  Clinton satisfied questions about trustworthiness when she noted that President Obama had trusted her enough to pick her to run the State Department  said Becky Schmitz  a social worker in Jefferson County  Before the debate  she leaned toward Mrs  Clinton but had doubts  Afterward  the doubts were gone  “She strengthened my position towards her ” Ms  Schmitz said  “She was very poised and strong  and I thought she carried the debate ”That was a sentiment shared even by Democrats who did not come away supporting Mrs  Clinton “I’d love to be a Hillary girl because I’d love to see a female president ” said Peggy Sherrets  the mayor of Oelwein  population 6 400  in northeast Iowa  “I’m just not sure she’s electable  I’m wondering if her time hasn’t passed ”Ms  Sherrets  too  seemed impressed with Mr  O’Malley  especially his statement that he had infuriated the National Rifle Association with gun control measures he passed as governor  “I grew up with guns and believe in the Second Amendment  but it’s gotten out of hand ” she said  “It’s gotten very scary  even in small towns ”Mrs  Clinton’s strong performance caused supporters of Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  to worry he has hesitated too long to enter the race  “I’ve kind of given up hope ” said Dean Lane  a farmer in Newton  who believes Mr  Biden would have an easier time winning a general election than Mrs  Clinton  who will continue to ignite Republican fury  “He would have had an easier time if he’d gotten in a month ago ”Mary Bruner  who runs human resources for her family owned bank in Carroll  approached the debate as if it were a job interview “I love Bernie’s passion and I love almost all of his positions ” she said  But she thought Mrs  Clinton offered the more “stellar résumé” and showed she had “people skills” needed for the presidency  “What was impressive was when another candidate was talking  she listened to them ” she said  “I thought she was genuine  I thought she was prepared ”Some voters who were unexpectedly impressed with Mr  O’Malley said he would be a better second choice candidate if somehow Mrs  Clinton stumbles  “Before  he had seemed milquetoast to me ” said Cal Tormey  a writer who works as a waiter in Des Moines  “I was impressed by how strong he came across ” But he still plans to caucus for Mrs  Clinton  whom he supported in 2008  “I’m trying to bet on the horse that I think will win ” he said Ben Nesselhuf  the vice president for development at an addiction treatment program in Sioux City  said he was still undecided after watching the debate “For Hillary Clinton  the bar was set high  and she went over it by a lot ” he said  “She’s had a rough six months with the Republicans zeroing in on her  and that’s taken a toll  I thought she was great last night ”A former chairman of South Dakota’s Democratic Party who moved to Iowa recently  Mr  Nesselhuf said that Mr  Sanders did “a good job introducing himself and his philosophy to a wider audience ” and that Mr  O’Malley “proved he belonged” in the race  As for the two other candidates on the stage  Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee  Mr  Nesselhuf said they were out of their league and “don’t belong on the stage ”Sarah and Bryan Vanderpool  professional folks singers who recently moved from Los Angeles  began the debate as Sanders supporters  Mr  Vanderpool was still one afterward  “He really spoke to the issues and I’m really excited about him ” he said But Ms  Vanderpool found herself unexpectedly drawn to the gravitational field of Mrs  Clinton  “I came in really  really supporting Bernie  and now I like them both ” she said  “She really handled herself well  she has a history of working on the stuff she’s going to be dealing with if she’s president ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Wins Iowa Fans With Debate Performance","print_headline":"Clinton Wins Iowa

are trying to make the rising cost of prescription drugs an issue in the presidential campaign Mr  Sanders introduced a bill in Congress this month  spelling out a host of policy changes to drive down drug costs  Mrs  Clinton tweeted on Monday that her plan would be released Tuesday  and her campaign has released some details Here’s why prescription drugs are bubbling up to the top of the Democratic health care agenda  Drug prices are bubbling up  Per capita drug spending increased by more than  100 last year  a big jump  At the same time  a growing share of Americans are being asked to foot the bill for their medicines  even if they’re insured  The Affordable Care Act  which has expanded insurance coverage  didn’t do much to counteract those trends Voters have clearly noticed the higher drug costs  This year  a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation asked people to identify health issues that they thought should be top priorities for the president and Congress  The No  1 issue was making drugs for serious diseases affordable  The No  2 issue  lowering the cost of prescription drugs  A follow up survey in August found that 24 percent of people said that they or a family member had declined to fill a prescription because of the cost Mr  Sanders said that hearing about this difficulty in obtaining needed medicines motivated his proposal  “It is totally absurd that if somebody does have health insurance and they walk into a doctor’s office and the doctor writes a prescription  they can’t fill it ” he said in an interview  “What sense is that?”Both candidates’ proposals include provisions that would allow Americans to import drugs from Canada  and that would allow the Medicare program to negotiate with drug makers when purchasing medications for the program  The Sanders plan also would require companies to share more information about their research and development costs  and increase penalties on pharmaceutical companies found guilty of fraud  The Clinton plan would impose a requirement that drug companies spend a set percentage of their revenues on research and development  and would cap the amount insurance companies could ask customers to pay each month for their medications to  250 After years in which Americans’ spending on drugs barely increased  last year they popped  Nationwide  spending on drugs increased by 12 percent when adjusted for inflation  according to federal government estimates A lot of that increase came from the introduction of some very expensive and popular new treatments for the chronic liver disease hepatitis C  But costly new drugs for cancer  multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disorders also explained the change  according to an analysis from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics  which tracks the pharmaceutical industry   The government numbers don’t count all drugs — some cancer medications and other drugs given by doctors aren’t included — but the number measures how much the country is paying for drugs sold through pharmacies  and that amount is rising  Just as the new and expensive treatments are entering the market  fewer older brand name drugs are going generic  The process of going generic has historically led to lower prices  Industry analysts say that drug companies are also aggressively lifting their pricing  Sometimes  companies are putting in big price increases for long established generic drugs  as my colleague Andrew Pollack recently wrote about Americans have long paid the highest prices for drugs  Because the United States gives drug makers long periods of patent exclusivity and lets a multitude of insurers each negotiate with drugmakers on price  drug spending here is  on a per capita average  roughly double the amount spent in many developed countries  That difference explains one of the planks of the candidates’’s drug proposals  to allow Americans to import Canadian drugs back into the United States Even Medicare  the government insurer for older Americans  doesn’t negotiate on drug prices in a unified way  instead  individual private plans each haggle for separate discounts  Both Mr  Sanders and Mrs  Clinton have talked about shifting to a system where Medicare negotiates as a monolith When drug costs go up  people tend to feel the change more acutely than they do increases in other parts of the health care system  even though prescription drug costs represent only a small portion of overall health care spending in the country  Government estimates suggest that prescription drug spending makes up only about 10 percent of federal spending on health care  There’s even research suggesting that use of pharmaceuticals often lowers other kinds of health care spending High drug costs are increasingly a problem even for the well insured  Most plans sold in the new Obamacare marketplaces include hefty deductibles for drugs of hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year  Even people who get their health insurance from large corporations  which tend to have the richest benefits  are expected to pay a growing share of their drug bill out of their pockets  Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation  which conducts a large survey of employers about their benefits  show the trend clearly  More than 40 percent of employers now ask their workers to pay deductibles of  1 000 or more  At small companies  more than 60 percent buy such plans A few employees every year get sick enough that they spend their deductibles on doctor or hospital care  But many more take prescription drugs  meaning that the cost of medications is an expense they encounter every month A growing number of plans are also adding special deductibles for drugs only  And insurance companies have been trying to discourage patients from choosing the most costly drugs by asking them to pay bigger co payments even after they’ve used up their deductibles  meaning patients who need such drugs may be paying a big bill all year long “They are having to pay the full cost of their prescriptions  not just the co payments  I think that’s the thing that’s changed ” said Murray Aitken  the executive director of the IMS institute  “The very real explanation is people are having more exposure to the full cost ”","headline":{"main":"Prescription Drug Costs Are Rising as a Campaign Issue","content_kicker":"On the

political parties To the Editor  Re “The Anti Party Men ” by David Brooks  column  Sept  8  Bernie Sanders is surging on the left because he authentically speaks to the economic concerns of ordinary Americans — unlike candidates who take their orders from elites while they simultaneously fatten their own wallets  Donald Trump is surging on the right for a more or less similar reason — even if his proposed solutions are wildly superficial  likely draconian and largely unrealistic  given how a majority of the country has no stomach for deporting 11 million people  Americans are hungry for an authentic populist movement — a movement that would place the real world concerns of ordinary Americans front and center and the obsessions of America’s wealthy  warmongering elites on the back burner  If seeking a decent life makes one an “expressive individualist ” then rational human beings should all be one  Americans on both the right and left increasingly resent being treated as mere serfs and cannon fodder in our elite’s great globalist games MATTHEW CARNICELLIBrooklynTo the Editor  We used to speak of alienation in society — the point at which an individual or group feels estranged from the political system  Today  some feel that their religious beliefs are at odds with secular society  Others who used to have a direct voice in politics through their unions now feel they have lost that voice  and their jobs to boot  And then there is the American tradition of blaming one’s woes on the most recent wave of immigrants The common ground may be that government is not getting its job done  People are more at ease with one another when they can go home to a reasonably comfortable life  secure in their beliefs  secure in their homes and secure against the unexpected  More people seem unable to say that today  despite generations of nation and wealth building Government is where a diverse society finds a common voice  However  for too long we have been trapped in the politics of disruption  and it is almost shocking when a compromise is reached  The special interests seem to control so much of what goes on  Hence  one is left with the feeling that nothing gets done The voice of the lone wolf is not so alone  He speaks to the frustration of people seemingly on the outside whose needs never seem to get met  And while we think the lone wolf can never win in the end  should the frustration of the voters boil over that is exactly what may happen  if a more severe revolt does not  Today’s leading candidates should listen carefully to the lone wolves in today’s races  They echo the frustration of millions of Americans BRUCE NEUMANSag Harbor  N Y To the Editor  David Brooks’s lumping of Senator Bernie Sanders with Donald Trump and Ben Carson was unwarranted  He is egregiously wrong to say of Mr  Sanders  “These sudden stars are not really about governing  They are tools for their supporters’ self expression  They allow supporters to make a statement  demand respect or express anger or resentment ”Mr  Sanders has been a successful mayor and longtime member of Congress  in both the House and the Senate  He has more experience of actually governing than most of the Republican candidates  In fact  he has more experience at governing than either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney had when they ran for president When Mr  Sanders was mayor of Burlington  the streets got paved in the summer and plowed in the winter while important economic development moved forward in ways that worked for business and residents  He has been continually re elected not because he is an ideologue  as journalists love to imply  but because he has made government work for the people of Vermont MICHAEL HECHMERWestford  Vt To the Editor  I don’t see much support for any of the current candidates  Republican or Democrat  Our citizens have become so cynical  jaded and divided that they no longer trust either party to act in their best interests  With the election of Barack Obama the people of this country unified around a set of ideas that made sense to them  Get us out of senseless war  Fix the economy  Provide us with decent wages and benefits  Enact meaningful health care reform  Clean up the environment Those who oppose these changes have fought diligently and successfully to stop them because they are controlled by the money behind them  This fragmentation you see in our political parties is simply the effect of too few people controlling our politics  Get the excessive PAC money out of campaigns and the problem will solve itself  Maybe  in a generation  voters will return to the ballot box because they will know that their vote will mean something PATRICK STEVENSMoose Lake  Minn To the Editor  The root of our political problem is the cumulative effect of decades of increasingly sophisticated  powerful marketing techniques designed to sell everything from fast food to sneakers  In order to sell stuff  marketing encourages us to be atomized  each of us focused on our personal wants and choices  The very idea of communality  which is at the heart of citizenship  has been massaged out of our individual consciousnesses to the point where “the common good” has become an archaic  fossilized concept  No politician even uses the phrase — it doesn’t play well in focus groups  Instead they talk about cutting our taxes Consumerism is the antithesis of citizenship  We respond as a consumer to Donald Trump because he has spent more than a decade marketing himself to us as a brand  And like any successful brand  he makes us feel good about ourselves because he tells us  “You deserve a break today ” And that’s what we want to hear MATTHEW HUGHESCaprile  ItalyTo the Editor  The last paragraph of David Brooks’s

the responsibility to make the compromises  build the coalitions  practice messy politics and sustain the institutions that throughout history have made national greatness possible ” But  on closer

for the United States and 11 other Pacific nations gathered in Atlanta on Wednesday to try to reach agreement on the largest regional free trade pact ever  But knotty differences persist  and antitrade blasts from American presidential candidates have not eased prospects for any deal The talks in a downtown Atlanta hotel are picking up where ministers left off two months ago after deadlocking at a Maui resort  at odds over trade in pharmaceutical drugs  autos  sugar and dairy goods  among other matters  United States negotiators said last week that enough progress had been made in recent contacts to justify hosting another  perhaps final round For President Obama  who cited the potential agreement during his address this week to the United Nations  success in a negotiating effort as old as his administration would be a legacy achievement  The proposed Trans Pacific Partnership would liberalize trade and open markets among a dozen nations on both sides of the Pacific  from Canada to Chile and Japan to Australia  that account for about two fifths of the world’s economic output Failure would be just as big a defeat for Mr  Obama  and upset his long troubled foreign policy initiative to reorient American engagement toward fast growing Asia and away from the violent morass of the Middle East and North Africa  Yet if the Atlanta talks yield no agreement by the weekend  the Americans are unlikely to declare failure Time is not the president’s friend  however  Even if agreement is reached this week  Congress will not debate and vote on it until late winter — in the heat of the states’ presidential nominating contests — because by law Mr  Obama cannot sign the deal without giving lawmakers 90 days’ notice He will need bipartisan support  given the resistance of many Democrats and union allies to such trade accords  But presidential candidates in both parties have already registered strong opposition The Republican front runner  Donald J  Trump  the billionaire who boasts of his own deal making prowess  has called the emerging trans Pacific agreement “a disaster ” While some Republican rivals also are critical  it is the rhetoric of Mr  Trump  given his celebrity appeal  that has Republican leaders more worried that a toxic trade debate could threaten vulnerable Republicans in 2016  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  supports a Pacific accord but nonetheless wants to protect his narrow Republican majority — and deny Mr  Obama an achievement On the Democratic side  where unions  progressive groups and many members of Congress oppose an agreement  Hillary Rodham Clinton has not taken a stand  though she repeatedly promoted the Pacific accord as secretary of state  In June  Mrs  Clinton told an Iowa audience “there should be no deal” if congressional Democrats’ concerns for workers were not addressed  and many in the party  including administration officials  expect she ultimately would oppose a deal  like her rival  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont The United States trade representative  Michael B  Froman  said before heading to Atlanta  “The president has made clear that he will only accept a T P P  agreement that delivers for middle class families  supports American jobs and furthers our national security ”“The substance of the negotiations will drive the timeline for completion ” Mr  Froman added  “not the other way around ”Mr  Obama and Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who has not ruled out a bid for president  showed at the United Nations that they were pressing hard to get an agreement  The president affirmed his support in private meetings with several world leaders  according to administration officials In his address to the United Nations  Mr  Obama told foreign leaders the accord would be a model for the world  “an agreement that will open markets  while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained ” Should a deal come together  central to the White House campaign to sell the agreement to Congress would be the argument that setting economic  labor and environmental standards in the Pacific region would counter China’s influence  officials said Late Tuesday  Mr  Biden brought Mr  Froman to a Manhattan meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan  who has made an agreement central to his own economic platform The Obama administration has pressed for the Pacific accord for six years  picking up the idea from the George W  Bush administration  Many issues have been all but settled  but nothing is final until everything is decided That progress  including tentative agreements on ending tariffs  setting labor and environmental standards  and opening certain markets  has sustained the negotiations despite setbacks But several issues continue to block a deal Dairy market rules divide the United States  Canada  Australia and New Zealand  this has been especially troublesome for Canada’s team  since the nation will hold elections this month Also divisive are provisions over auto exports  including requirements that autos have a certain percentage of parts made in countries that are parties to the agreement  Japan has sought a lower percentage of parts in the “rules of origin ” with some support from Americans  to allow the export of autos with Chinese parts  while Mexico and Canada demand stricter rules Perhaps most contentious are negotiations related to protections for pharmaceutical companies’ drugs  especially cutting edge biologics that are made from living organisms and considered promising against cancer  among other ailments Several countries  especially Australia  have opposed the United States and its pharmaceutical industry for insisting that companies’ drug data be protected for 12 years to create financial incentives to innovate  Critics say this keeps lower cost generic drugs and “biosimilars” off the market for too long Here  too  the presidential contest has injected a wild card  Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders each have accused drug makers of price gouging While there is talk of an eight year compromise  for many opponents that is too long  Judit Rius Sanjuan  a manager of a campaign by Doctors Without Borders to hasten access to lower priced drugs and vaccines  said she met with American negotiators last week in Washington  “and they gave me zero indication that they are going to be more flexible on this issue ”Andrew Spiegel  executive director of the Global Colon Cancer Association  said drug makers needed the incentives of strong protections for their intellectual property to encourage their research  He did not offer an answer to the question dividing negotiators  how many years the drug makers’ data monopoly should last “I leave it to them to pick the magic number ” Mr  Spiegel said Last week  156 members of Congress  mostly Democrats  wrote the administration to complain that some parties to the talks  like Vietnam  Singapore and Japan  manipulate their currency values to underprice their products  While discussions are continuing  the administration is counting on reaching a currency deal

DAVENPORT  Iowa – On a day Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush scheduled campaign events a few miles apart  Mrs  Clinton jabbed at two Bushes — the one running for president and the brother who once had the job Mrs  Clinton disparaged Mr  Bush’s “stuff happens” comment about gun violence  and she repeatedly invoked what she considers the policy failures of George W  Bush’s presidency  including deep tax cuts for the wealthy and an effort to privatize Social Security Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Bush circled each other in Iowa on Tuesday as the struggling standard bearers of their parties’ establishments  Both were once seen as likely general election opponents  Now they each face serious challenges from populist outsiders At a town hall style event in Davenport  Mrs  Clinton staked out several positions — reining in Wall Street and supporting gun control and ambitious public works projects  for example — that seemed influenced by the Democratic Party’s leftward shift in recent years Later in the day  she said she had sent every Republican candidate a copy of her book “Hard Choices” after Carly Fiorina and others questioned what she had accomplished as secretary of state  “There are so many of them ” she said  referring to the 15 candidates in the Republican field  “they could have a book club ”The Bush campaign quickly hit back over Mrs  Clinton’s use of a private email server in the State Department  and suggested that she read Mr  Bush’s book “Reply All” when it is published in a few weeks  “The book  based on Governor Bush’s emails while in office  is a good lesson on the importance of transparency in government ” said a campaign spokeswoman  Kristy Campbell  who added that Mr  Bush had not received Mrs  Clinton’s book Mr  Bush  setting off on his longest Iowa swing as a candidate  is hoping to deepen his support in a state where he has few natural advantages — and the poll numbers to prove it  Before his scheduled remarks Tuesday evening at the Scott County Republicans annual Ronald Reagan Dinner in Bettendorf  Mr  Bush’s campaign announced a handful of new endorsements in the state  including one from Mayor Steve Gaer of West Des Moines  a former Scott Walker supporter whose blessing had been sought by other candidates appealing to Main Street Republicans At the event  Mr  Bush  repeating an argument he made in an op ed article in The Des Moines Register on Tuesday  took up the difficult task of casting himself as an outsider  disparaging Washington as a city where “home prices never dropped during the financial crisis ”“Washington is doing fine ” he told the crowd  “What we need to do is disrupt Washington ”He also repeated his plan to dock the pay of federal lawmakers who miss votes  in what has been viewed as a swipe at Senator Marco Rubio of Florida  who has missed them frequently “They should go to the committee hearings  they should vote ” Mr  Bush said Mrs  Clinton promised to unveil proposals next week to “go after Wall Street abuses” and hold banks and individuals responsible for “their bad behavior ” an issue that regularly stirs loud applause at the rallies of Senator Bernie Sanders  the Vermont independent who is challenging her for the Democratic presidential nomination Despite benefiting from the support of wealthy Democratic donors on Wall Street  Mrs  Clinton approvingly noted that Ben S  Bernanke  the former Federal Reserve chairman  said while promoting his new memoir that “people should have gone to jail” after the financial crisis of 2008 On gun control  where Mr  Sanders has been skeptical of the push for new restrictions  Mrs  Clinton seemed to have both him and Mr  Bush in mind when she disparaged Mr  Bush’s comment  after the shooting massacre last week at an Oregon community college  that “stuff happens ”“This doesn’t just happen ” Mrs  Clinton said  “This isn’t stuff that happens  We let it happen  and we have to act ”In a lighter moment  Mrs  Clinton was asked by an attendee to do her impression of Mr  Trump that she debuted on “Saturday Night Live” over the weekend  Mrs  Clinton obliged  “Oh  you’re a loser ” she said in a deep voice  to laughter But the challenge of Mr  Trump and the other outsiders of both parties — for Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Bush as well — was illustrated by an attendee at the Clinton event  Jerry Propps  a retired truck driver  Although Mr  Propps said he was making up his mind between Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders  he acknowledged he was also drawn to issues that Mr  Trump had highlighted  the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and immigration “When it comes to allowing illegal immigrants in this country  I’m sorry to say  I’m with Trump on that ” he said Coincidentally  Mrs  Clinton’s itinerary on Tuesday  from Davenport to Muscatine  retraced the route of Mr  Sanders during a visit to Iowa in May  when a crowd of 700 was an early warning to the Clinton campaign of his nascent support here  Mrs  Clinton  eclipsed by Mr  Sanders in New Hampshire polls  is still hanging on to a slender margin in Iowa “I think a lot of people are looking at Bernie Sanders  but I don’t think hardly anyone is going to vote for him ” said a Clinton

Biden Jr  became the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987  a few months ahead of his first and ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign  he told aides his goal was to enact legislation that would take a comprehensive approach to reducing crime As the ranking minority member of the committee since 1981  Mr  Biden had helped pass two bills establishing mandatory minimums for drug offenses  But as chairman  facing high violent crime rates  a crack cocaine epidemic  and accusations by Republicans that his party was soft on crime  Mr  Biden wanted holistic reform The effort  which defined much of his time as committee chairman  culminated in the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act  a sweeping  bipartisan bill that touched nearly every aspect of American law enforcement that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton More than two decades later  that legislation is once again the subject of fierce debate — this time  as a bipartisan coalition of activists and lawmakers seeks to undo the era of mass incarceration they say the 1994 crime bill helped create The rapid shift in mood that those efforts reflect — a reaction to falling crime rates and a renewed attention to issues of racial injustice — could prove one of many hurdles for Mr  Biden if he decides to become a candidate for president Already  in the 2016 presidential race  criminal justice has commanded a level of attention unseen since the 1990s and has compelled both Republicans and Democrats to have something new to say about it  For Mr  Biden to win support from the young voters who were critical to President Obama’s election victories  according to activists like Jeremy Haile  he will need to show his views have evolved “Any Democrat that is interested in gaining support among the current electorate  particularly the progressive civil rights communities  is going to have to say that previous tough on crime policies were a mistake ” said Mr  Haile  federal advocacy counsel at the Sentencing Project Hillary Rodham Clinton  who in a sense faces the same challenge  addressed the issue in her first major policy speech as a candidate in April  Amid violent protests and riots in Baltimore  Mrs  Clinton made an emotional appeal to overhaul an “out of balance” criminal justice system and end “the era of mass incarceration ”A representative for the vice president said in a statement that Mr  Biden had always opposed certain “elements of the law — like the three strikes measure — that he did not think would function as their proponents intended ” And he felt that other parts of the law  like relief from mandatory minimum sentences for certain first time nonviolent drug offenders  should have gone further  the representative said The vice president’s office also said Mr  Biden had played a “critical” role in the Obama administration’s continuing efforts to overhaul the system  meeting with members of Congress and participating in “high level staff discussions ”In a sign of the shifting mood  former President Bill Clinton  who long viewed the crime legislation as a major achievement of his administration  told the national convention of the N A A C P  in July that it in fact went too far in toughening sentencing standards and thus contributed to mass incarceration  a once controversial term now widely used “I signed a bill that made the problem worse ” Mr  Clinton said  “And I want to admit it ”Despite reservations  Mr  Biden  who has served as the Obama administration’s unofficial liaison to the law enforcement community  has not only stood by the 1994 legislation  but has also frequently taken credit for it  As recently as this spring  in an essay on community policing for a book of bipartisan reform proposals put together by the Brennan Center for Justice  Mr  Biden referred to the legislation as the “1994 Biden Crime Bill ”Mr  Clinton wrote in a foreword to the book that “our nation has too many people in prison and for too long — we have overshot the mark ” Mr  Biden  in contrast  stressed the success of the bill’s community policing measures  which he said had achieved their goals before funding was cut And in an interview with Time magazine in February 2014  he said  “I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar  but I’m also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of [the Senate Foreign Relations Committee] trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine  for example  crack and powder ”Activists say it would take an acknowledgment by Mr  Biden similar to Mr  and Mrs  Clinton’s to begin to get the ear of the young minority voters so crucial to Mr  Obama’s coalition “Many of us who grew up in the black community in the ’90s ” said Patrisse Cullors  a political organizer and co founder of the Black Lives Matter movement  “we witnessed the wave in which the policies that came from both federal government but also local government tore our families apart ”“I think that any person coming to office who was really a part of that is going to have to deal with a large amount of criticism from those who were affected by this policy ” she said Just as important  Ms  Cullors said  is for candidates to offer concrete proposals to roll back policies that have contributed to racial disparities in the criminal justice system and replace them with new ones “that are about valuing black life ”Those are very different terms from those that filled the national conversation during Mr  Biden’s tenure as Judiciary Committee chairman from 1987 to 1995  a period when Democrats fought hard to revise a caricature of the party as soft on crime The 1994 crime bill provided tens of billions of dollars to put thousands of additional police on the streets  build new prisons  increase border protection  and fund crime prevention programs  It included several measures — including the Violence Against Women Act and a federal ban on certain assault weapons — that remain popular among many Democrats But it also eliminated Pell Grants for prison inmates  criminalized gang membership  contained  9 7 billion in funding for new prisons  established a three strikes provision that mandated life sentences for people with two or more prior convictions found to have committed a violent felony  and gave states incentives to lengthen sentences  These measures  many experts now say  helped give the United States the highest incarceration rate in the world Today  about 2 2 million Americans are locked up in federal and state prisons and local jails  twice as many as when Mr  Clinton took office Aides from Mr  Biden’s time on the Judiciary Committee said that he had to make compromises  including on sentencing disparities between cases involving powder cocaine and those involving crack cocaine  which disproportionately affected African Americans  to ensure the passage of otherwise good legislation  They also said that by the time the 1994 bill was drafted  Mr  Biden had come to oppose mandatory minimum sentencing In 2007  during his last presidential bid  Mr  Biden introduced legislation that would have eased that disparity  The following year he offered another bill that aimed to confront systematic racial inequities  Neither measure passed  though another Biden backed bill that provided increased resources to ease former offenders’ re entry into the community  the Second Chance Act  was enacted around the same time Brittany Packnett  a St  Louis based activist who is a member of Mr  Obama’s 21st Century Policing task force  said that when she and other activists met with Mr  Biden and other White House officials last December  it was apparent that the vice president understood the urgency of the issue “People at their best always evolve ” Ms  Packnett said  “But we need to be told the story of that evolution  This needs to be clarified for us such that any plan that he puts forward addressing this would be seen as believable ”","headline":{"main":"Joe Biden’s Role in ’90s Crime Law Could Haunt Any Presidential Bid","print_headline":"In New Climate, &#8217;94 Crime Bill

It’s not to have a moderate as our nominee ”For much of the past half century  Republicans approached campaigns for the White House with confidence in their natural advantage  Five victories in six races from 1968 through 1988 spurred talk of a Republican presidential lock Now that Democrats have won the popular vote in five of six elections — with demographic projections auguring future gains — the roles have reversed  Republican strategists don’t hide fears that Donald J  Trump’s immigration rhetoric will further alienate the fast growing Hispanic constituency At this early stage of the 2016 race  that frees Democratic primary voters to entertain supporting Mr  Sanders “Right now  there’s no cost to saying you like Bernie Sanders ” said Anna Greenberg  a Democratic pollster  She warned that the sense of risk would rise — to Mrs  Clinton’s benefit — this winter  when “having a Republican in the White House as a possibility will be very motivating ”Like Mr  Devine  Ms  Greenberg has seen the evolution in partisan fortunes up close  In 1985  amid Democratic despair over Walter Mondale’s landslide loss to Ronald Reagan  her father  Stan Greenberg  studied “Reagan Democrats” for clues to regaining a national majority  That led an ambitious Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton to make Mr  Greenberg his pollster Mr  Clinton won the White House in 1992 by campaigning as “a different kind of Democrat ” By supporting the death penalty and an overhaul of welfare  he showed an electorate then still 87 percent white his willingness to challenge liberal orthodoxy By 2012  when President Obama won re election  white voters had shrunk to 72 percent  Democratic domination of the other 28 percent  a group that demographers project will keep growing  fuels the party’s confidence “We have a bigger pool to draw from ” Ms  Greenberg said  But she noted the threat from Latino Republican candidates such as Senator Marco Rubio  “It is not a fully realized majority  I don’t think we can take Hispanic voters for granted ”Mr  Devine acknowledges that concerns over Mr  Sanders’s electability are a barrier for the Vermont senator that may grow as the campaign wears on “For Bernie to succeed  there’s going to have to be a huge amount of reassurance for the institutional Democratic Party ” he said  Democratic officeholders  he explained  must be convinced Mr  Sanders can inspire turnout among Obama friendly constituencies such as young people  single women and nonwhites in ways that not only help him  but help them  too Surprisingly solid fund raising makes that possible  Mr  Devine said  So do decades of frustration among middle class and blue collar families over the failure of conventional Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver income gains “They’re just fed up with it  and they really want someone to do something about it ” he said  “The pieces are there ”","headline":{"main":"Timing Gives Sanders a Lift in His Quest","content_kicker":"Letter From America","kicker":"Letter From America","print_headline":"Timing Gives Sanders a Lift in His Quest"},"wordCount":"641"},

stared suspiciously at the visitor who was pointing to the attic of his pink and shingled house near Brooklyn College “I used to live here ” Steve Slavin explained  to no noticeable reaction from Mr  Williams  Then he uttered the magic words  “With Bernie Sanders ”“Bernie?” Mr  Williams  a 78 year old immigrant from Guyana  exclaimed  “I was just watching Bernie on the TV ”Hillary Rodham Clinton may be a former senator from New York who located her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights  but all it takes to know who really represents Brooklyn in the race for the Democratic nomination is for Mr  Sanders to open his mouth and utter a few syllables As Mr  Sanders  a senator from Vermont  draws large crowds on the campaign trail and enjoys an unexpected surge  his Brooklyn accent and upbringing in the heavily Jewish neighborhood of Flatbush off Kings Highway have become a particular point of pride for friends  former schoolmates and fellow progressives in the borough where he was born “I’m very proud of the fact that he speaks Brooklyn  because he’s not a phony  and that shows ” said Marty Alpert  who used to cheer for Mr  Sanders when he was on the track team at James Madison High School  where she is now on the alumni board On the school’s crowded Wall of Distinction  Mr  Sanders is no longer quite so overshadowed by such alumni as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Senator Chuck Schumer and four Nobel Prize winners  or  for that matter  Judge Judy and Cousin Brucie Mr  Slavin was Mr  Sanders’s roommate when they were both students at Brooklyn College  Now retired from teaching economics  Mr  Slavin recalled staying up late listening to music on Mr  Sanders’s record player and discussing Supreme Court cases  Marbury v  Madison in particular  And he remembered how Mr  Sanders would curse when they heard their loathed landlady angrily marching up the stairs “He was a lifer ” Mr  Slavin said  meaning that Mr  Sanders had known only one place his entire life In fact  Mr  Sanders was on the verge of leaving — first for the University of Chicago  where he transferred from Brooklyn College  and ultimately for Vermont But Brooklyn’s imprint on Mr  Sanders was not limited to his tongue  In the populist politics he has espoused for decades as a leftist activist  socialist mayor  and independent congressman and senator  those who knew Mr  Sanders  who declined to comment for this article  detect the influence of postwar Brooklyn stickball games  arguments over money between his parents  and the work ethic instilled in him as a decorated long distance runner “He is 100 percent Brooklyn ” said Larry Sanders  the candidate’s older brother  who decades ago traded in his Brooklyn accent for a British one when he moved to England and pursued Green Party politics The Sanders brothers lived with their parents in a prewar apartment building on East 26th Street that had a fake fireplace in the lobby  In apartment 2C  Mr  Sanders and his brother swapped nights in a small bedroom and living room  ate their mother’s meat heavy dinners  and made occasional outings to the local delicatessen and Chinese restaurant Their father  a paint salesman who emigrated from Poland at age 17  worked out of Long Island and put 25 000 miles a year on his car  The family rarely discussed politics and  according to Larry Sanders  looked at their grandfather  “a very strong socialist ” as “eccentric ”What their parents did talk about was money  “There were tensions about money  which I think is important ” he said  “There was no sense of long term security  A salesman  things can go up and things can go down ”But if that at all contributed to the senator’s economic populism  then his appreciation for an equal playing field was influenced by the self regulating society of street games outside their house Sid Ganis  a past president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  who lived downstairs from the Sanders family  recalled a roving gang of Jewish kids who would play stickball  marbles and boxball  all without adult meddling “In a way  when Bernard talks about cooperatives and so on  he is drawing on something that was real for many years ” his brother said  “That the people who did it  ran it ”Mr  Sanders went to elementary school at P S  197 and spent his Saturday mornings at the Nostrand movie theater watching cartoons and serials with his brother  They took occasional trips into Manhattan  including one visit to Rockefeller Center where his brother recalled a “Vermont state propaganda place” that made the brothers marvel at the affordability of the land  When Mr  Sanders married years later  he used money from his wedding presents to buy acres in Montpelier Mr  Sanders started attending Madison  just down the street from his family’s apartment  in 1955  Walter Block  now an economics professor and libertarian at Loyola University New Orleans  would walk to school with Mr  Sanders through what he called a “pretty pinkish” neighborhood  On Bedford Avenue  they would enter a school that was a city in itself With about 5 000 students and split schedules between underclassmen and juniors and seniors to thin out hallway traffic jams  there was also a hunger to move up in the world “We wanted to count ” said Larry Hite  a well known commodities trader who graduated the same year as Mr  Sanders Mr  Sanders was a good student  He wrote for the school paper and ended up running for school president  but he had to settle for president of his class  His brother introduced him to Freud and taught him why Thomas Paine’s “Common Sense” was superior to Edmund Burke’s conservatism While others would eat pizza at Louis Gino’s  hang out at the Avalon Tearoom or avoid Dubrow’s Cafeteria after school  Mr  Sanders’s free time was spent on the track  As a tall freshman with a long stride  he became one of the borough’s top long distance runners  He became so used to winning that in one race at Prospect Park  he pushed his co captain  Dan Jelinsky  ahead of him “so that I came in first ” Mr  Jelinsky recalled These days  the school is pushing Mr  Sanders out front and center  Jodie Cohen  the school’s principal  talks about how happy she was when she heard he was running  “If Bernie wins and then Chuck becomes majority leader ” she said  referring to Mr  Schumer  “all of Madison’s dreams will become a reality ”Ms  Alpert  the alumni board member  is also enthusiastic about the attention Mr  Sanders is getting  She said that when a counterpart at nearby Midwood High School inquired about creating its own Wall of Distinction  the Madison board members responded  “Besides Woody Allen  who have you got?”But the end of Mr  Sanders’s years at Madison was not a happy time  His mother  whose heart had been weakened by a bout of rheumatic fever as a child  had taken ill  He lost interest in track and enrolled  unhappily  in Brooklyn College “He wanted to go to Harvard ” said Lou Howort  73  a track teammate After Mr  Sanders’s graduation in 1959  his brother returned from Harvard Law School to be close to their mother as her condition worsened  It was around that time that Mr  Sanders rented a furnished room with Mr  Slavin on East 21st Street in the attic of a Madison Latin teacher and his wife Mr  Slavin said that his old roommate needed some space from the tensions at home  and that Mr  Sanders was crushed when his mother died when she was just 46 after a second heart operation failed By the end of his year at Brooklyn College  Mr  Sanders was more than ready to leave for Chicago  When finals came around  according to Mr  Slavin  he paid less attention to his exams than to the books he brought back from the college library  He was particularly fond of a biography of John Peter Altgeld  a 19th century progressive Illinois governor who championed child labor laws  supported striking workers and challenged the Democratic powerhouse of the time  Grover Cleveland Now  as he challenges the current Democratic powerhouse  Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Sanders’s hometown supporters hope that a combination of his unabashed liberalism  long distance runner’s persistence and old school Brooklyn charm will resonate with voters It already does resonate with Mr  Williams  who shrugged off his own family’s analysis that Mr  Sanders’s being “straight up honest” would only get him so far “It’s great that the future president lived in my house ” Mr  Williams said ","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders’s ‘100% Brooklyn’ Roots Are as Unshakable as His

Mrs  Clinton still has tremendous advantages in the Democratic primaries and remains a clear favorite for the nomination  She commands overwhelming support from the party’s elite  which has given her a big financial advantage  attracted a robust national organization full of the party’s most talented operatives  and deterred mainstream challengers  Her policy views are right in the middle of the Democratic Party  even if there is room to challenge her from the left in Iowa and New Hampshire  there is little room to do so in the rest of the nation’s primaries But Mrs  Clinton’s decline now extends beyond what I  at least  would have expected  It is still not enough to call her advantage into question  but it suggests that many analysts might have underestimated the resonance of the controversy surrounding her private email account and server at the State Department  And it creates a real quandary for Mr  Biden For the first time in Mrs  Clinton’s two decades in national politics  more Americans see her unfavorably than favorably  Her net favorability rating — now a dismal minus 10 or perhaps worse — is at least 15 points worse than it was at this time in 2008 She hasn’t lost ground only among Republicans or Republican leaning independents  but also among Democratic voters  I don’t have a comprehensive data set of Mrs  Clinton’s old favorability ratings among Democrats  but a quick survey of polls from August and September 2007 showed Mrs  Clinton with 80 percent to 88 percent favorability ratings among Democrats  Today  they range from 65 percent to 77 percent  That shouldn’t be a surprise  given how far her national ratings have slipped It is hard to argue that these losses were inevitable  given that they now place her beneath where she was in the last 2008 primary — a contest she entered with far less support from voters and party elites than she held at the beginning of this year  They raise the possibility that political scientists and data journalists — including this one — have underestimated the significance of the email affair  which is the simplest — if unproven — explanation for those losses The email controversy is unusual  There has been no indictment or even allegations of criminality  But whether it’s a true scandal or not  by now it has all of the trappings of one  generating an F B I  investigation  congressional hearings  an aide’s pleading of the Fifth Amendment  lawyerly explanations about the deletion of documents  It has dragged on for months and fits into a longstanding narrative of the Clintons’ trouble with honesty The faster decline in Mrs  Clinton’s standing began in mid July  when the F B I  began an investigation into the release of classified information in her email account  It was also about the time when Mr  Biden began investigating entering the race Most data journalists and political scientists had argued that the email revelations were just another muddled  politicized dispute that would quickly split the electorate along partisan lines  But recent surveys — like an ABC Washington Post survey from this week — show that a significant minority of Democrats  29 percent to 33 percent  depending on the question  disapprove of her handling of questions about her email account  think she broke government regulations or think she tried to cover up the facts Perhaps all of these voters would have opposed her in the primary anyway  Mrs  Clinton  after all  still has a big lead in national polls  It’s no longer a record setting advantage  But it’s a big one  and it’s underpinned by all of the fundamentals that help determine the outcome of the primary contest  This time  she won’t be facing a candidate  like Barack Obama  who has the potential to peel away a big part of her coalition Party elites haven’t begun to leave her candidacy either  Over the last month  Mrs  Clinton has rolled out still more endorsements  Reports from a meeting of the Democratic National Committee suggested that few party members were itching to jump ship So if the damage is done  if saying “sorry” marks the moment when the controversy begins to fade  if the investigation doesn’t take any future turns for the worse  then Mrs  Clinton could remain in a strong position to win the nomination  She could probably recover ground — both in terms of her ratings and in the early primary states  The “Clinton Comeback” narrative  almost as familiar as the scandal prone one  would emerge in a matter of time But it’s impossible to rule out the possibility that the email investigation — or its effect on public opinion — could take a new turn Mrs  Clinton’s poll numbers — both in the Democratic primary or among all Americans — can’t afford to fall too much further before party leaders would justifiably begin to reassess her candidacy That creates a real problem for Mr  Biden  He seems genuinely conflicted about whether to run for president  even setting aside his grief and anguish after the death of his son Beau He’s considering a run at a highly unusual moment  He would be well positioned to capitalize if Mrs  Clinton faltered  But he would probably lose by a wide margin if the race stayed as it is  He might not win even one state  He would lack the resources and elite support necessary to build a competitive national campaign at this stage  and there just might not be an opening But one thing is clear  He doesn’t have much more time to wait and see if the Clinton campaign founders ","headline":{"main":"Signs of Hillary Clinton’s Troubles, in

increasingly frustrated by Hillary Rodham Clinton’s failure to put to rest questions about her State Department email practices and ease growing doubts among voters about her honesty and trustworthiness On top of that  many say  her repeated jokes and dismissive remarks on the email controversy suggest that she is not treating it seriously enough Interviews with more than 75 Democratic governors  lawmakers  candidates and party members have laid bare a widespread bewilderment that Mrs  Clinton has allowed a cloud to settle over her candidacy — by using a private email server in the first place  since it was likely to raise questions about her judgment  and by not defusing those questions once and for all when the issue first emerged in March With Americans registering their mistrust of Mrs  Clinton in opinion polls  anxious supporters are starting to speak bluntly of fears that she has inadvertently opened the door to a possible challenge for the party’s nomination from Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   and handed Republicans new ammunition for attacks on her character should she become the nominee Among some of Mrs  Clinton’s advisers  discussions recently turned to whether she should offer a more forceful acknowledgment of regret — if not the actual words “I’m sorry” — that might help the campaign move on Mrs  Clinton took a step on Wednesday by saying at an Iowa campaign stop that she took “responsibility” for conducting government business as secretary of state using her personal email  and that “it clearly wasn’t the best choice ”Yet many Democrats worry that this newly contrite tone is too little and too late to quell questions  and that it may not last — given that her responses up to now have been so varied  and her irritation with the issue so thinly veiled “They’ve handled the email issue poorly  maybe atrociously  certainly horribly ” said Edward G  Rendell  a former governor of Pennsylvania and a supporter of Mrs  Clinton’s candidacy  “The campaign has been incredibly tone deaf  not seeing this as a more serious issue  She should have turned over the email server at the start  because they should have known they’d be forced to give it up  But at this point  there’s nothing they can do to kill the issue — they’re left just playing defense ”Rosalind Wyman  a veteran Democratic national committeewoman from California who is also a Clinton supporter  said Mrs  Clinton had not shown enough urgency in battling questions about her judgment  and complained that the campaign’s responses to the controversy — and the federal inquiries that have followed — were becoming only more muddled “The only thing Hillary can do  I think  is get out there in front of reporters and take five hours of questions — if that’s what it takes — until people understand her  at least  and hopefully believe her ” Ms  Wyman said  “And we have to have people who are talented  independent experts on classified secrets defending her on television  rather than who we have now ”Criticisms about Mrs  Clinton also threaten to complicate the political fortunes of other Democratic candidates over the next 15 months  should they find themselves having to defend her instead of focusing on issues and going on the offensive against Republicans “I obviously think the sooner Secretary Clinton can get this behind her  the better ” said Jason Kander  the secretary of state in Missouri  who is running for the Senate next year against the Republican incumbent  Roy Blunt Mrs  Clinton has stressed that her use of only a private email account was legal  and she is not a target of a federal investigation  which is focused on assessing any security breaches Still  with hundreds of Democratic National Committee members gathering in Minneapolis this week for their summer meeting — at which Mrs  Clinton and other candidates will speak on Friday — several said in interviews that they would be listening closely to her remarks on the email issue In Kentucky  where a hard fought governor’s race will be decided in November  some Democrats are privately fretting that Mrs  Clinton’s problems could damage the party’s brand  The departing Democratic governor  Steven L  Beshear  said he believed that Republican attacks over Mrs  Clinton’s email use would continue through the fall and beyond — and that the Clinton campaign had to devise a strategy of more effective countermoves “Honestly  at this point there isn’t any great way to handle it ” Mr  Beshear said  “While Hillary Clinton has been straight up from the very beginning  the Republicans will not let the issue die  and they will conduct as many witch hunts as possible  She will really have to start addressing those attacks as the campaign becomes more active ”At dinner parties and fund raisers this summer  over phone calls and text messages  Mrs  Clinton’s staunchest backers have sought to reassure restive Democrats that the email controversy will eventually run its course  and that Mrs  Clinton remains the strongest Democrat against Republican candidates in 2016 None of the Democrats interviewed went so far as to suggest that the email issue raised concerns about Mrs  Clinton’s ability to serve as president  and many expressed a belief that it had been manufactured by Republicans in Congress and other adversaries  Some Clinton allies emphasized that the presidential race was still in an early stage — the primaries do not start until February — and that Mrs  Clinton had plenty of time to influence voters’ perceptions of her “Democrats need to take a deep breath ” said Gov  Dannel P  Malloy of Connecticut  “The attacks on her email are just that  attacks  and are coming because Republicans understand she is the toughest candidate to beat ”“People have fatigue over the summer in thinking about political attacks ” he added  “but I don’t think it’s fatigue with Hillary herself ”Asked about Democrats’ concerns  Brian Fallon  a Clinton spokesman  said  “We are confident that as the public sees more of the emails  it will clear the air  In the meantime  we are showing that we are on the case by addressing the legitimate questions that have been asked  while not losing focus on the issues that matter most ”Mrs  Clinton’s staff largely shares her view that the news media have been unfair  and a sense of frustration has set in  Aides have privately told supporters that the email issue is not going away anytime soon Mrs  Clinton’s aides  many of whom are new to her circle  are by and large running a playbook that is dictated by the candidate  according to several Democrats in close contact with the campaign who insisted on anonymity to preserve their access to it  But even so  they must be especially careful because of the inquiries underway For his part  former President Bill Clinton is said to be pleased with the campaign’s approach but exasperated that so little of its efforts have eased concerns Yet several Democrats went public with long simmering frustrations about the Clinton team’s response “They need to be much more forthright  I don’t think it has been handled well  Where is Terry McAuliffe?” said John Morgan  a trial lawyer and Clinton donor  referring to the aggressive  plain spoken chairman of Mrs  Clinton’s 2008 campaign who is now the governor of Virginia  “I want to see Terry McAuliffe come out  take off the gloves and explain this to America ”He added  “This is not a time to parse words  This is a time to be very direct ”“I think it’s made things tougher on her because it has given people like Joe Biden this sense of ‘Maybe me ’ ” Mr  Morgan added  echoing several other Democrats who said that Mr  Biden would not be considering a run if Mrs  Clinton did not seem vulnerable as a candidate In Iowa and New Hampshire  crucial states because they vote first for presidential nominees  Clinton allies said that they do not believe she has been losing support over the email issue — but that the real test will come as the campaign intensifies this fall and winter “Her critics are going to look around  see fog and say  ‘Aha  fire ’” said Michael Gronstal  the Democratic leader of the State Senate in Iowa  “So it will continue ”James M  Demers  a top supporter and fund raiser for Mrs  Clinton in New Hampshire  said it was “too early to tell if the email issue is turning people off ”“It’s very hard to explain the government systems of classifying information  all the rules  and keep people focused on accurate answers ” Mr  Demers said A number of Democrats said in interviews that they were disturbed when Mrs  Clinton had joked that her Snapchat account messages “disappear all by themselves ” and had reacted peevishly to a reporter’s question about wiping her server   “What  like with a cloth or something?” she had replied  “Instead of flippant and smart aleck comments  it would just be better to come clean in a straightforward way ” said Pat Cotham  a Democratic national committeewoman and county commissioner from North Carolina  “People don’t expect you to be perfect  but they just want to know what the deal is ”Ms  Cotham said she had received overtures from supporters of Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Biden  among others  but had not yet settled on a candidate “Her judgment about her email is like a fly buzzing around ” she said  “You’ve got to swat it and get it out of the picture ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton’s Handling of Email Issue Frustrates Democratic

month  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  will escape for a family retreat to mourn his late son  Beau  but also to mull  as his dying son urged him to do  a campaign for president  Some of Mr  Biden’s friends and allies worry that he will decide it is a good idea Those supporters  in the White House and the Senate  and within the political circles he has moved in for decades  fear that the legacy Mr  Biden has built as an effective partner who took on tough jobs for President Obama  not to mention the deep reservoir of public good will and sympathy he has amassed in his poignant handling of personal tragedies  could be sacrificed in the pursuit of an unsuccessful challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination They fret that Mr  Biden  as well known for his undisciplined  sometimes self immolating comments as he is for his charm on the trail  could endanger Mr  Obama’s own legacy by injuring Mrs  Clinton’s candidacy and causing his party to lose control of the White House While the concern about Mr  Biden appears widespread among his political allies  few seem eager to tell him out of fear of hurting his feelings and seeming to be presumptuous about a decision that is all too personal “People deeply care about him and admire him ” said one person who is personally close to Mr  Biden and has worked closely with him  speaking on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his relationship with the vice president  “But you obviously have to worry about the feasibility and ultimate impact of a run ”Asked if people were eager to communicate that concern to Mr  Biden  this associate said  “It’s very hard to do ”In a series of interviews  admirers of Mr  Biden inside and outside the administration said they understood Mr  Biden’s interest in running given his years at the highest levels of government but were mindful  and hoped he was mindful  that it could end disastrously  But they are concerned that the rawness of his son’s death has made processing the pluses and minuses of running difficult Mr  Obama  according to those knowledgeable about his sentiments  feels highly protective of his No  2 and is worried about the effects of a presidential race at a difficult personal time for Mr  Biden In a sign of the conflicting pressures surrounding Mr  Biden  the vice president has told people that the terminal brain cancer of Beau Biden  who died in May  had caused him to consider resigning the vice presidency to take care of his grieving family  though those aware of the vice president’s thinking say that idea never became too serious David Axelrod  a former Obama adviser who has spoken with Mr  Biden  said what many were thinking about the feasibility of his candidacy “I understand completely why he would consider running ” said Mr  Axelrod  pointing to Mr  Biden’s 36 years in the Senate and two terms at Mr  Obama’s side  “On the other side is the reality of running for president  The fund raising  the demands of campaigning and organizing  the constant and irritating exposure and the prospect of running against a well fortified opponent who has a huge head start  Add all that up  and it is a counterweight to why he should run ”Senator Richard J  Durbin  Democrat of Illinois  said Mr  Biden appreciated “better than any candidate in the race” the rough and tumble nature of presidential campaigns  “He’s been through this before  he understands what is involved ”But Mr  Durbin contended that legacy should not be part of Mr  Biden’s consideration because “the reputation he enjoys in this country is solid  whatever his final decision ”Some of his donors agreed and have been encouraging  to a point “He just has to look inside himself and decide  and people like me will support whatever decision he makes ” said Richard Davis  a donor to and supporter of Mr  Biden in New York  “But I only want him to proceed if he concludes he has a reasonably good chance of actually winning ”But others say that Mr  Biden  who struggled in White House races in 1988 and 2008  should not be reluctant to jump in  and they noted that he showed a command of the issues and performed strongly in debates that have become increasingly important presidential campaign moments “Sometimes people forget how well he did ” said former Senator Kent Conrad  a North Dakota Democrat who served with Mr  Biden  “Joe has a humanity about him that comes across  He is for real  He believes in things  He is able to articulate his values  and I think he would acquit himself extremely well ”White House officials and others say Mr  Biden’s long record of public service gives him the right to make his own decision on his own timetable and to proceed as he chooses  Those close to Mr  Biden  who is 72  say they note a bit of condescension in suggestions that he should be satisfied with his achievements  Friends say the views of Washington “wise men” are unlikely to influence a decision they expect to be made by Mr  Biden and his immediate family “There’s a family vacation in the near future  and that’s where the decision would be made for sure ” said John Marttila  a veteran Democratic campaign strategist who worked on Mr  Biden’s first Senate campaign in 1972 and was a close adviser to Mr  Biden on his subsequent presidential runs  “The one characteristic I would use to describe him is family man  And it is with his family that a decision will be made ”While the sudden attention on Mr  Biden’s plans has reminded Democrats of their fondness for the vice president  it has also called to mind his capacity to misspeak on the campaign trail  Admirers of Mr  Biden who asked not to be identified so that they could speak candidly without upsetting him said that the qualities that the public now sees as endearing — his talkativeness and avuncular approach — might not seem so appealing if he were to become a full blown candidate  And news organizations are already going back over his long record  calling attention to potentially negative aspects Some political veterans who talked with the vice president and did not want to be named said his best option might be to remain on the sidelines and see how the Clinton campaign and others play out “If he lets it percolate ” one said  “it might come to him ”But such a strategy requires the implosion of Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  and while her candidacy worries some in the party  she remains popular and the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination  To that end  the talk about Mr  Biden seemed to slightly annoy some of her supporters “I’m strongly supporting Hillary and her run ” Senator Barbara Boxer  Democrat of California  said when asked about Mr  Biden  “And  you know  the vice president should do whatever is in his heart  It’s up to him ”","headline":{"main":"Friends of Joe Biden Worry a Run for President Could Bruise His Legacy","print_headline":"Biden Friends Worry Run Could Bruise Legacy

this year  The electorate is in an anti establishment mood  and as a longtime insider  Biden  I argued  would suffer from the same disadvantages Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are now enduring  without any of their advantages  It would end badly But then came Biden’s moment with Stephen Colbert  His discussion of his own grief over his son Beau’s death was beautiful and genuine and revealed the golden heart that everybody knows is at the core of the man Biden talked about Beau  “My son was better than me  And he was better than me in almost every way ” He gestured toward how fluid grief is  how it goes round and round  hides for a few hours and then suddenly overwhelms  But there was something else embedded in that Colbert moment  a formation story Every presidential candidate needs a narrative to explain how his or her character was formed  They need a story line that begins outside of politics with some experience or life defining crucible moment that then defines the nature of their public service Candidates like John F  Kennedy and John McCain were formed by war  Candidates like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were formed by their rise from broken homes and their dedication to lift others and heal divisions  Without a clear formation story  a candidate is just a hodgepodge of positions and logos Democrats this year are looking for a formation story that proves commitment  This is a party that is moving boldly leftward  Its voters want to know their candidate has the inner drive to push through structural changes  not just half measures Bernie Sanders has such a story  From his days at the University of Chicago onward  he has been a pile driver for progressive causes  regardless of the prevailing winds  Hillary Clinton hasn’t yet presented a clear formation story  She talks about being a grandmother  which humanizes her  but doesn’t explain how she got to be the person she is With Colbert  one saw the kernel of a Biden formation story that could connect not only with Democratic voters but with other voters as well  It is a story of dual loss  his wife and daughter decades ago and his son this year  Out of that loss comes a great empathy  a connection to those who are suffering in this economy and this world  Out of that loss comes a hypercharged sense of mission  Out of that loss comes a liberation from the fear of failure that dogs most politicians  and causes them to dodge  prevaricate and spin People who have suffered a loss often want to connect their tragedy to some larger redemptive mission  Biden could plausibly and genuinely emerge sadder but more empathetic and more driven  That would be not only a natural reaction  but also the basis for a compelling campaign  Biden would then benefit from the greater verbal self discipline he has developed while vice president and from the fact that this year  as Donald Trump proves  voters seem tolerant of free talkers Democratic voters aren’t the only ones looking for a strong formation story  Republicans are looking for one  too  but the nature of the Republican race is different  If Democrats are arguing over what positions to fight for  Republicans are arguing about how to fight Republican presidential candidates have found that the strongest way to win favor on the stump is to attack the leaders of their party in Congress for being timid and inept  Many Republican voters are alienated from their party’s leadership  They’re looking for a candidate who can lead a mutiny Donald Trump’s mutiny story is pretty clear  In doing business deal after business deal  he mastered the skills needed to take on the morons who are now running the party and the world  Ben Carson’s story is clear  too  Through his faith and through his medical career he developed the purity of heart and the discipline of will required to walk into Washington without being corrupted by the rottenness found there The Republican desire for a mutiny has kept Trump and Carson aloft longer than most people supposed  I still think they will implode  Their followers need them to be the superheroes they are portraying themselves to be  But politics is hard  especially for beginners  and sooner or later they will flounder and look like they’re in over their heads  At that point it’s all over  At that point  a Bush  Rubio  Kasich or Walker will have an opening to tell a different and more positive story On the Democratic side  a Biden run would be more formidable than I thought last month  You need emotion to beat emotion  With Stephen Colbert he revealed a story and suggested a campaign that is moving  compelling and in tune with the moment ","headline":{"main":"The Biden Formation Story","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"The Formation

patina of entitlement and inevitability  has led to this Destroying digital messages and thwarting official investigations while acting all innocent about wiping out sensitive material Avoiding reporters after giving disingenuous explanations at uncomfortable news conferences  Claiming egregious transgressions are a private matter and faux controversy while sending out high power lawyers and spin doctors to deflect and minimize Two controlling superstars with mutable hair and militant fans  married to two magnetic superstars who can make a gazillion an hour for flashing their faces and who have been known to stir up trouble A pair of team captains craving a championship doing something surreptitious that they never needed to do to win It turns out Tom Brady and Hillary Clinton have more in common than you would think Brady had his assistant terminate his Samsung phone the day before he talked to an investigator about Deflategate  Hillary set up a home brew private server  overruling the concerns of her husband’s aides  and erased 30 000 emails before the government had a chance to review them to see if any were classified Brady and Hillary  wanting to win at all costs and believing the rules don’t apply to them  are willing to take the hit of people not believing them  calculating that there is no absolute proof They both have a history of subterfuge — Brady and the Patriots with Spygate  Hillary with all her disappearing and appearing records Robert Kraft  the owner of the Patriots  is out there rabidly defending Brady  The crafty Hillary has her own rabid defender in David Brock  Kraft and Brock both have a financial interest  of course  in bleaching the images of their quarterbacks  Hillary and Brady have billion dollar operations  and their sketchy value systems force people around them into seamy Faustian bargains These may be mere speed bumps for these top players  But in the case of Hillary  problems of style and substance are starting to scuff her sheen of inevitability There are tensions in her campaign that echo the failed 2008 campaign  Her rare interviews have seemed robotic and infused with the queenly attitude that put off people last time  before she melted in New Hampshire and decided  as in “Frozen ” to Let it go  Can Hillary convey authenticity only when she thinks she’s losing?Once more  she has figuratively and literally roped off the press  sloughing off her promise at a journalistic dinner four months ago for a fresh start Her strategists worry about surveys showing that voters do not trust her  But her private server is a metaphor for her own lack of trust and a guarded  suspicious mind set that lands her in needless messes The Wall Street Journal on Thursday offered yet another unsavory saga of what appears to be Clinton back scratching  After Hillary  as secretary of state  intervened to help make a deal where UBS had to turn over only a small fraction of the account information sought by the I R S   UBS amped up its donations to the Clinton Foundation and paid Bill Clinton  1 5 million to do some Q  and A ’s for the company Hillary is lucky that she faces a crowded  absurdist Republican field cowering in the shadow of the megalomaniacal showman Donald Trump But two recent Quinnipiac University polls show her unfavorability rising in swing states  She now trails Jeb Bush by one point  after leading him by 10 in May  and Joe Biden leads Jeb by one point Many Democrats fret that she seems more impatient than hungry  more cautious than charismatic  They are increasingly concerned that  aside from the very liberal Bernie Sanders  who could be approaching his ceiling in the early states  there is no backup if something blows up — no Jimmy Garoppolo to step in while Brady is suspended for four games Potent friends of America’s lord of latte  Howard Schultz  have been pressing him to join the Democratic primary  thinking the time is right for someone who’s not a political lifer  For the passionate 62 year old — watching the circus from Seattle — it may be a tempting proposition After coming up from the housing projects in Brooklyn  Schultz reimagined Starbucks and then revived it  He has strong opinions  and even position papers  about what he calls the fraying American dream  While he was promoting his book on veterans last year  he honed a message about making government work again and finding “authentic  truthful leadership ”Joe Biden is also talking to friends  family and donors about jumping in  The 72 year old vice president has been having meetings at his Washington residence to explore the idea of taking on Hillary in Iowa and New Hampshire He gets along with Hillary and has always been respectful of the Democratic Party’s desire to make more history by putting the first woman in the Oval Office But going through the crucible of the loss of his oldest son  Beau  to brain cancer made the vice president consider the quest again As a little boy  Beau helped get his father through the tragedy of losing his beautiful first wife and 13 month old daughter in the car crash that injured Beau and his brother  Hunter When Beau realized he was not going to make it  he asked his father if he had a minute to sit down and talk “Of course  honey ” the vice president replied At the table  Beau told his dad he was worried about him My kid’s dying  an anguished Joe Biden thought to himself  and he’s making sure I’m O K  “Dad  I know you don’t give a damn about money ” Beau told him  dismissing the idea that his father would take some sort of cushy job after the vice presidency to cash in Beau was losing his nouns and the right side of his face was partially paralyzed  But he had a mission  He tried to make his father promise to run  arguing that the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values Hunter also pushed his father  telling him  “Dad  it’s who you are ”It could be awkward for President Obama  who detoured from the usual route — supporting your vice president — and basically passed the torch to Hillary  Some in Obama’s circle do not understand why he laid out the red carpet for his former rivals  “He has no idea how much the Clintons dislike him ” said one former top White House official But the president has been so tender and supportive to his vice president ever since learning that Beau was sick  it’s hard to say how he will react  Since the funeral  Obama has often kept a hand on Biden’s back  as if to give him strength When Beau was dying  the family got rubber bracelets in blue — his favorite color — that said “WWBD ” What Would Beau Do  honoring the fact that Beau was a stickler for doing the right thing Joe Biden knows

associates have begun to actively explore a possible presidential campaign  which would upend the Democratic field and deliver a direct threat to Hillary Rodham Clinton  several people who have spoken to Mr  Biden or his closest advisers say Mr  Biden’s advisers have started to reach out to Democratic leaders and donors who have not yet committed to Mrs  Clinton or who have grown concerned about what they see as her increasingly visible vulnerabilities as a candidate The conversations  often fielded by Mr  Biden’s chief of staff  Steve Ricchetti  have taken place through hushed phone calls and quiet lunches  In most cases  they have grown out of an outpouring of sympathy for Mr  Biden since the death of his son Beau  46  in May On Saturday  the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd reported that Mr  Biden had been holding meetings at his residence  “talking to friends  family and donors about jumping in” to challenge Mrs  Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire  the first two nominating states One longtime Biden supporter said the vice president had been deeply moved by his son’s desire for him to run “He was so close to Beau and it was so heartbreaking that  frankly  I thought initially he wouldn’t have the heart ” the supporter  Michael Thornton  a Boston lawyer  said in an interview  “But I’ve had indications that maybe he does want to — and ‘that’s what Beau would have wanted me to do ’ ”Mr  Biden’s path  should he run  would not be easy  Mrs  Clinton has enormous support among Democrats inspired by the idea of electing a woman as president  and her campaign has already raised millions of dollars Additionally  Mr  Biden  who is 72  has in the past proved to be prone to embarrassing gaffes on the campaign trail  He would also face the critical task of building a field operation One Democrat with direct knowledge of the conversations described the outreach as a heady combination of donors and friends of Mr  Biden’s wanting to prop him up in his darkest hours  and of recent polls showing Mrs  Clinton’s support among independents declining  suggesting there could be a path to the nomination for the vice president Ms  Dowd reported that as Beau Biden lay dying from brain cancer  he “tried to make his father promise to run  arguing that the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values ” Mr  Biden’s other son  Hunter  also encouraged him to run  she wrote The support Mr  Biden has garnered speaks to growing concerns among Democrats that Mrs  Clinton could lose in Iowa and New Hampshire  as the populist message of one of her opponents  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  draws swelling crowds “The reality is it’s going to be a tough  even steven kind of race  and there’s that moment when a lot of party establishment would start exactly this kind of rumble  ‘Is there anybody else?’ ” said Joe Trippi  a Democratic strategist At the same time  the slow trickle of news about Mrs  Clinton’s use of private email when she was secretary of state  and the coming Benghazi hearings  may be distracting some voters from the core message of her campaign  the need to lift the middle class “It’s not that we dislike Hillary  it’s that we want to win the White House ” said Richard A  Harpootlian  a lawyer and Democratic donor in Columbia  S C   who met with Mr  Ricchetti before Beau Biden died  “We have a better chance of doing that with somebody who is not going to have all the distractions of a Clinton campaign ”A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign declined to comment In a July 30 Quinnipiac poll  57 percent of voters said Mrs  Clinton was not honest and trustworthy  and 52 percent said she did not care about their needs or problems  The same poll showed Mr  Biden with his highest favorability rating  49 percent  in seven years  with 58 percent saying he was honest and trustworthy and 57 percent saying he cared about them  But Mrs  Clinton’s numbers are still strong  especially among likely Democratic primary voters “The No  1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy  and the veep is leading in those polls ” said William Pierce  executive director of Draft Biden  a “super PAC” that is trying to build enthusiasm for a possible candidacy Mr  Biden could still decide not to run  Confidants say they expect him to make something official by early September  Other than by not ruling out a run  and by holding preliminary meetings  he has not openly fueled speculation about his candidacy  As of Saturday  he had no trips planned to Iowa or New Hampshire in the coming weeks  But an intermediary recruited by the vice president’s office has been in touch with potential staff members who have not yet signed on to the Clinton campaign Kendra Barkoff  a Biden spokeswoman  said  “As the Biden family continues to go through this difficult time  the vice president is focused on his family and immersed in his work ”A 2016 run would be the third time Mr  Biden  a longtime senator from Delaware  had sought the presidency  which friends say is his ultimate dream Mr  Biden’s first campaign in 1988 ended in heartbreak after news reports that he plagiarized parts of a speech and exaggerated his academic record forced him to drop out  In 2008  he drew less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses and dropped out after making controversial comments about Barack Obama  then seeking his first term in the White House  Mr  Biden said he was “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean ”Mr  Obama later chose Mr  Biden as his running mate  In the early months of the 2016 campaign  the president has been careful not to undermine or wholeheartedly endorse either his former secretary of state or his vice president “The president has said that the best political decision he’s ever made in his career has been to ask Joe Biden to run as his vice president ” Eric Schultz  a White House spokesman  said last week Friends described Mr  Biden’s relationship with Mrs  Clinton in the Senate as cordial and warm  But in his long career in Democratic politics  Mr  Biden has clashed with former President Bill Clinton  and his relationship with Mrs  Clinton has not been without awkwardness  One close Biden confidant  Ron Klain  has been in contact with Mrs  Clinton’s campaign about helping her prepare for the Democratic debates  a sign some people interpreted as evidence that Mr  Biden would decide against a run Mr  Ricchetti  a White House aide in the Clinton administration who is now Mr  Biden’s chief of staff  began talking to donors and supporters in the months before Beau Biden died In recent weeks  those talks  with local elected officials and party leaders  started again  mostly because well wishers were calling to check on the Biden family  The talk inevitably drifted to 2016  and many of these Democrats urged Mr  Biden to seriously consider getting into the race  said people with knowledge of the talks who agreed to discuss private conversations only anonymously Mr  Ricchetti declined to comment The speculation intensified on Thursday when friends of Mrs  Clinton’s spotted Mr  Ricchetti having breakfast at the Four Seasons in Washington with Louis B  Susman  a major donor and former ambassador to Britain  Fox News reported on the meeting Mr  Susman — who has already made the maximum donation allowed in the primary   2 700  to Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  and who is a longtime friend of the Biden family — dismissed any implication that he was discussing the vice president’s plans  “He wasn’t testing the waters with me ” Mr  Susman said of Mr  Ricchetti  “There was never any discussion of the presidential campaign or money ”Mr  Biden is by no means a virtuoso campaigner  But his entry into the race would add an unbridled  often unscripted passion for the presidency that some Democrats say the ever cautious Mrs  Clinton at times lacks One Democratic donor with direct knowledge of the overtures from the Biden camp said Mr  Biden had already thought about how he would position himself in the race  delivering an economic message to the left of Mrs  Clinton’s while embracing Obama administration policies  like health care reform  that are widely popular among Democrats ","headline":{"main":"Joe Biden Said to Be Taking

eager to jump start a flagging campaign  expressed support for a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding and likened his fights with lawmakers in Wisconsin to the movie “Braveheart ”Jeb Bush reveled in the weeds of his tax plan and federal discretionary spending  appearing grateful for the chance to address a policy forum — until a discussion of his long held support for Common Core education standards inspired hearty boos  “Hang on a second ” he pleaded  “You’re going to like the ending of this story ”And Ben Carson  the retired neurosurgeon ascending in recent weeks toward the top of the polls  brandished the understated charm that has powered his rise  He entered to a standing ovation  thanked his hosts for inviting him on the day he was turning 64  and was promptly serenaded by the crowd with a full rendition of “Happy Birthday ”“People think doctors only know medicine ” he said later  defending his qualifications as far reaching  “They’re nuts ”Two days after their second televised debate scrambled the race anew — perhaps most notably elevating the profile of Carly Fiorina — nearly all the Republican contenders for president descended on South Carolina on Friday for a conference organized by the conservative group Heritage Action for America   The group is the political arm of the Heritage Foundation  founded in 1973 and transformed in recent years from a staid policy incubator to an organizing engine fueled by the Tea Party movement  The most striking exception was Donald J  Trump  who had been scheduled to appear  His campaign said that a pending business transaction had forced him to cancel  a development that Heritage Action called “unfortunate ”  Mr  Carson joked that the news of Mr  Trump’s dropping out was the “best birthday present ” In his absence  Mrs  Fiorina  propelled on Wednesday by a memorably steely exchange with Mr  Trump over his disparaging comments about her looks  moved to build her case as a top tier candidate   One of Heritage Action’s moderators  Gov  Nikki R  Haley of South Carolina  quipped of Mrs  Fiorina  “This is what a smart  intelligent face looks like ” In her own comments  Mrs  Fiorina cited her history as an executive  including her history interacting with China  in a forceful call to action that earned several sustained ovations “Pressure applied by citizens on their representatives will move the system ” she said  “President Fiorina will call on you as citizens of this great nation to take our government back ”Mr  Bush  who was generally received warmly  cast himself as “a disrupter in Tallahassee” during his time as governor  suggesting his peers had comparatively thin résumés “There are people who have been elected to Congress who have done a good job fighting President Obama  but they’ve never actually passed a law ” he said  urging people to “look at the governors” for records of true accomplishment In her questioning  Ms  Haley spoke particularly warmly of a fellow governor  Mr  Walker  and his bruising battles with union leaders in Wisconsin Mr  Walker  who again complained of his limited speaking time during the debate  drew sustained cheers during a discussion of Planned Parenthood  He said he supported attempts by Republicans in Congress to try to strip the group of federal funding  even if that leads to a government shutdown Mr  Walker emphasized what he described as his battle ready toughness  hyperbolically likening his fight with members of his own party in the Wisconsin State Legislature to the bloody Mel Gibson biopic “It was kind of like I had the face paint on ” he said  “I had the battle charge ready ”Yet few candidates could claim the reception earned by Mr  Carson from the several thousand people who attended the gathering in the Bon Secours Wellness Arena here  In contrast to several of his competitors  whose appearances on stage were preceded by slick introductory videos  Mr  Carson prepared a segment of ostensibly low production value  chiefly  Mr  Carson speaking into a single camera Once on stage  he described  at Ms  Haley’s urging  a youthful indiscretion  identifying as a liberal long ago  after spending formative years in Detroit and Boston and at Yale University “I was a radical Democrat  and I believed all this stuff that they believed  including that Republicans were horrible racist people ” he said  to laughs  “And then I started listening to Ronald Reagan ”The tone shifted sharply at the entrance of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  who assailed Republican leaders for failing to fight sufficiently for conservative causes “We have met the enemy  and they is us ” he said  paraphrasing a famous comic strip He marveled that  in the era of the Affordable Care Act  Republicans had managed in 2012 to nominate a candidate  Mitt Romney  who had overseen similar efforts as governor of Massachusetts “Literally there are 7 billion people on the face of planet Earth ” he said  suggesting the party would have been better off approaching one of them at random Mr  Cruz accused many Republicans in Washington of seeking to become “bosom buddies” with their peers  though he stumbled over the line  emitting something resembling “boosy buttoms ”The crowd laughed “Freud’s going to have a field day with that ” he said ","headline":{"main":"Varied Pleas as Candidates Press

Not something you usually see at a political event Maggie  Yes  that injected something different Dr  Carson’s tone is incredibly conversational  Wow Pat  Very  There is something warmer about him than in his usual appearances  He took off his glasses — that helps Maggie  Yes  And standing with his wife is very humanizing  as they introduce their children But this is unlike any announcement I’ve seen before Pat  Me  too  Including his early joke about how the media misquotes him — suggesting that his anecdote about beating his wife at pool would generate a media headline  “Carson admits he beats his wife ”Maggie  Yes  That was…unusual Most of the time when we do these chats I am racing to keep pace with what the candidate is saying  But this one is a slow roll between applause lines Pat  It lets him laugh and smile a lot  A good thing Maggie  Definitely  This story about his mother is very intense  There is no other candidate who is going to tell a story like this  I suspect  Jokes about drug dealers  Rats and roaches Pat  Powerful  “She was never able to get beyond the third grade ” And later divorced Carson’s father because he was a bigamist  And so her dream of education transferred to Carson and his siblings “I remember when our favorite drug dealer was killed ”    “They used to bring us candy  We liked to see the drug dealers ”Maggie  This story  and the way in which he is telling it  are a real reminder why he could do well with the grass roots Sent at 11 06 AM on MondayPat  I could see him having genuine appeal with Iowans who feel like the coastal elites don’t understand hard lives Maggie  Exactly  He’s the antithesis of the 1 percent  in terms of his personal story  His oratorical style is so different from what we have seen from most candidates  He’s very soft spoken Pat  And it matches his first piece of policy  “I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them  I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able bodied people ”It’s a variation on compassionate conservatism Maggie  Exactly  “I’m not an antigovernment person by any stretch of the imagination ”“Now we’ve gone far beyond what our constitution describes ” He is making a connection between power grabs and government  as opposed to a rote “big government” argument Pat  Does that make him different from his Republican rivals running for president?Maggie  It’s basically the same argument  But I think the presentation is softer Sent at 11 11 AM on MondayPat  I think he’s different in the sense that he’s criticizing what he calls “the political class” over and over again  Carly Fiorina used the same phrase in her presidential announcement video today  The slogan of insurgents Maggie  I think that’s right  “We are outsiders ”I think the difference is that Fiorina has run for major office before  was a Clinton Global Initiative participant     and  I think  has a harder time selling the outsider message Sent at 11 13 AM on MondayPat  A harder time  but one that primary voters might relate to – at least more than they connect to a laundry list of policy proposals Maggie  Yes  And the rhetoric isn’t just pure fire Pat  He is appealing to voters as Americans and human beings  not presuming they are political junkies Now he’s quoting Nathan Hale  Patriotic fervor Maggie  Yes – and now he’s talking about people defending the country  This is a well constructed speech “I want to do what’s right ”In case you didn’t know  he’s not a politician Pat  An easy applause line  as he’s finding now by the audience’s cheers Maggie  This is interesting  pivoting to Baltimore Pat  “I believe the real issue here is that people are losing hope  and they don’t feel that life is going to be good for them no matter what happens ”“So when an opportunity comes to loot  to riot  to ‘get mine ’ they take it ”Maggie  That’s a powerful line Also  what he just said about hearing that everything is wonderful “when your eyes tell you something different ”Pat  “Stop being loyal to a party or to a man  and use your brain to think for yourself ”That will resonate  But are there enough independent minded people who will respond to that? The presidential caucuses and primaries are so dominated by hard core party loyalists Maggie  Polls would indicate not Pat  Now Carson  a retired neurosurgeon  is hitting the Affordable Care Act  a k a  Obamacare  Maggie  This is almost on minute 55 Pat  Hahaha  Hillary’s announcement video clocked in at 2 minutes and 18 seconds  and Bernie’s press conference was about 10 minutes  Ben Carson’s event is epic by comparison Maggie  These attendees are getting their free ticket’s worth I think he needs to wrap this up soon Pat  Both Sanders and Carson started their events by noting they didn’t have much time  Carson began this event saying  “We have limited time ”But he’s now getting to the economy  The challenge is  he’s talking about the G D P  and the unemployment rate in an overly detailed way Maggie  Yes  exactly  This is very  very micro Pat  But then he uses vivid language like “chains and feathers ” He would be a memorable figure in televised debates Maggie  Calling for a new stimulus Sent at 11 26 AM on MondayPat  This is amazing  He suggests a new stimulus can come by the wealthy bringing back their offshore income and profits and giving them a “tax holiday” — and the audience cheers  Are there billionaires in that audience?Maggie  Hahaha – exactly Carson is now promising to change government from a “behemoth of inefficiency”Sent at 11 28 AM on MondayPat  Who are these men who have now appeared behind him on the stage  in the half darkness?Maggie  I’ve never seen something like this  ever Pat  I thought they were going to give him the hook Maggie  Here are my advisers  And now they’re in the shadows  Literally folks Pat  Very unusual theater It’ll be interesting to see how this speech ends — he is speaking well off the cuff  but he’s not building oratorically to a memorable moment Maggie  OK  he is going over stuff he’s said before Ah there we go  Well  a sudden end Maggie  Final thoughts? Survey says?Pat  I wonder if he got the hook from C Span when he hit the 60 minute mark Maggie  That could be  Paging Steve Scully Pat  Final thoughts  I think Carson will do extremely well in town hall event settings in Iowa and New Hampshire  He has a directness and empathy that will connect Maggie  I totally agree  I think he’s going to go farther than people realize Pat  But anyone looking for detailed  original policy ideas will be left wanting Can he become more than an insurgent candidate? How might he do that?Sent at 11 36 AM on MondayMaggie  I think he has a lot of ground to make up in such a crowded field  That having been said  he’ll be very interesting to watch Pat  Agreed  Chat w u soon Maggie  Bye  ","headline":{"main":"The Chat: Ben Carson&#8217;s Announcement, Instantly Analyzed","kicker":"First Draft"},"wordCount":"1376"},

neurosurgeon turned political insurrectionist  was trying to check off another box on his presidential campaign to do list  hiring a press secretary  The lead prospect  a public relations specialist named Deana Bass  had come to meet him at the dimly lit Capitol Hill office of Carson’s confidant and business manager  Armstrong Williams  Carson sat back and scrutinized her from behind a small granite table  as life size cardboard cutouts of more conventional politicians — President Obama  with a tight smile  and Senator John McCain  glowering — loomed behind each of his shoulders   The mock  3 bill someone had left on a table in Williams’s waiting room undercut any notion that this was a bipartisan zone  it featured Obama wearing a turban  Bass seemed momentarily speechless  and not just because no one had warned her that a New York Times reporter would be sitting in on her job interview  Though she knew Williams — a jack of all trades entrepreneur who owns several television stations and a public affairs business and who hosts a daily talk radio show — through Washington’s small circle of black conservatives  the two hadn’t spoken in years until he called her two days earlier  He had been struggling to come up with the perfect national spokesperson  he told her  Then  at the gym  her name popped into his head  Williams was fairly certain she was the one  Sitting across from a likely candidate for president  Bass was adjusting to the idea that her life might be about to take a sudden chaotic turn “It’s like getting the most random call on a Monday that you simply do not see coming ” she said  “Oftentimes  that is how the Lord works ”Carson concurred  “It’s always how he works in my life ” Carson is soft spoken and often talks with his eyes half closed  frequently punctuating his sentences with a small laugh  even if the humor of his statement is not readily apparent  Bass told Carson that she had been a Republican staff member on Capitol Hill then worked for the Republican National Committee  In 2007 she started a Christian public relations firm with her sister  She enjoyed working on the Hill  she said  but the pay wasn’t as high as the hours were long  “We figured that we worked like slaves for other people  and we wanted to work for ourselves ”Carson stopped her  “You know you can’t mention that word  right?” Carson waited a beat  then laughed  and Williams and Bass joined in  He was getting to the point  he needed a professional who could help him check his penchant for creating uncontrolled controversy just by talking The Ben Carson movement began in 2013  when Carson  a neurosurgeon  whose operating room prowess and up from poverty back story had made him the subject of a television movie and a regular on the inspirational speaking circuit  was invited to address the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington  With Barack Obama sitting just two seats away  Carson warned that “moral decay” and “fiscal irresponsibility” could destroy America just as it did ancient Rome  He proposed a substitute for Obamacare — Health Savings Accounts  which  he said  would end any talk of “death panels” — and a flat tax based on the concept of tithing  His address  combined with the president’s stony reaction  was a smash with Republican activists  Speaking and interview requests flooded in  Carson  then 61  announced his planned retirement a few weeks later  freeing his calendar to accept just about all of them  In the months that followed  his rhetoric became increasingly strident  The claim that drew the most attention  perhaps  was that Obamacare was “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery ”Bass’s own use of the word prompted Carson to ask her what she thought about that incident  She considered for a moment “If you want to reach people and have them even understand what you’re saying  there is a way to do it  without that hyperbole  that might be        ” She paused  “I just think it’s important not to shut people off before they —”Carson jumped in  “That doesn’t allow them to hear what you’re saying?”Bass nodded Likening Obamacare to slavery — and slavery was incomparably worse  Carson said — had its political advantages for a candidacy like his  It was the kind of statement that stoked the angriest of the Republican voters  conservative stalwarts who can’t hear enough bad things about Obama  This  in turn  led to more talk radio and Fox News appearances  more book sales  more donations to the super PAC started in his name  more support in the polls   The day before the meeting  one poll of Republican voters showed Carson statistically tied for first place with Jeb Bush and Scott Walker  Rhetorical excess was good for business  but Carson now wants to be seen as more than a novelty candidate  He has come to learn that such extreme analogies  while true to his views  aren’t especially presidential  They alienate more moderate voters and  perhaps even more damaging  reinforce the impression that he is not “serious” — that he is another Herman Cain  the black former Godfather’s Pizza chief executive who rose to the top of the early presidential polls in 2011 but then bowed out before the Iowa caucuses  largely because of leaked allegations of sexual misconduct  which he denied but from which he never recovered  Cain lingers as a cautionary tale for the party as much as for a right leaning candidate like Carson  The fact that Cain  with his folksy sayings  “shucky ducky”  and misnomers  “Ubeki beki beki beki stan stan”   reached the top of the national polls — much less that he was eventually followed there by the likes of Michele Bachmann  Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum  who all topped one or another poll in the 2012 primary season — wound up being a considerable embarrassment for the eventual nominee  Mitt Romney  and for the longtime party regulars who were trying to fast track his way to the nomination Carson liked Bass and  without directly saying so  made it clear the job was hers for the taking  Carson’s campaign chairman  Terry Giles — a white lawyer whose clients have included the comedian Richard Pryor and the stepson of the model Anna Nicole Smith and who helped reconcile the business interests of the descendants of the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  — had assembled a mostly white campaign team  including many from the 2012 Gingrich effort  and Carson wanted a person of color to speak for him  Bass said she would have to mull it over  pray about it  Carson nodded approvingly  “Pray about it ” he said  “See what you think ”Williams knew the party was intent on protecting the eventual 2016 nominee from the same embarrassment Romney suffered  Already  suspiciously tough articles about Carson were showing up in conservative magazines and on right wing websites  “They’re protecting these establishment candidates ” Williams said  “This is coming from within the house  This is family ” At the very least  he wanted to make sure that Carson didn’t do their work for them   Carson would commit another unforced error a week later  when he told CNN that homosexuality was clearly a choice  because a lot of people go in prison straight and “when they come out  they’re gay”  he later apologized  “We need somebody to protect him  sometimes  from himself ” he told Bass — laughing  but only half kidding A candidacy like Carson’s presents a new kind of problem to the establishment wing of the G O P   which  at least since 1980  has selected its presidential nominees with a routine efficiency that Democrats could only envy  The establishment candidate has usually been a current or former governor or senator  blandly Protestant  hailing from the moderate  big business wing of the party  or at least friendly with it  and almost always a second   third  or fourth time national contender — someone who had waited “his turn ” These candidates would tack predictably to the right during the primaries to satisfy the evangelicals  deficit hawks  libertarian leaners and other inconvenient but vital constituents who made up the “base” of the party  In return  the base would  after a brief flirtation with some fantasy candidate like Steve Forbes or Pat Buchanan  “hold their noses” and deliver their votes come November  This bargain was always tenuous  of course  and when some of the furthest right activists turned against George W  Bush  citing  among other apostasies  his expansion of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit  it began to fall apart  After Barack Obama defeated McCain in 2008  the party’s once dependable base started to reconsider the wisdom of holding their noses at all This insurgent attitude was helped along by changes in the nomination rules  In 2010  the Republican National Committee  hoping to capture the excitement of the coast to coast Democratic primary competition between Obama and Hillary Clinton  introduced new voting rules that required many of the early voting states to award some delegates to losing candidates  based on their shares of the vote  The proportional voting rules would encourage struggling candidates to stay in the primaries even after successive losses  as Clinton did  because they might be able to pull together enough delegates to take the nomination in a convention floor fight or at least use them to bargain for a prime speaking slot or cabinet post This shift in incentives did not go unnoticed by potential 2012 candidates  nor did changes in election law that allowed billionaire donors to form super PACs in support of pet candidacies  At the same time  increasingly widespread broadband Internet access allowed candidates to reach supporters directly with video and email appeals and supporters to send money with the tap of a smartphone  making it easier than ever for individual candidates to ignore the wishes of the party Into this newly chaotic Republican landscape strode Mitt Romney  There could be no doubt that it was his turn  and yet his journey to the nomination was interrupted by one against the odds challenger after another — Cain  Michele Bachmann  Newt Gingrich  Rick Santorum  Ron Paul  always Ron Paul  It was easy to dismiss the 2012 primaries as a meaningless circus  but the onslaught did much more than tarnish the overall Republican brand  It also forced Romney to spend money he could have used against Obama and defend his right flank with embarrassing pandering that shadowed him through the general election  It was while trying to block a surge from Gingrich  for instance  that Romney told a debate audience that he was for the “self deportation” of undocumented immigrants At the 2012 convention in Tampa  a group of longtime party hands  including Romney’s lawyer  Ben Ginsberg  gathered to discuss how to prevent a repeat of what had become known inside and outside the party as the “clown show ” Their aim was not just to protect the party but also to protect a potential President Romney from a primary challenge in 2016  They forced through new rules that would give future presumptive nominees more control over delegates in the event of a convention fight  They did away with the mandatory proportional delegate awards that encouraged long shot candidacies  And  in a noticeably targeted effort  they raised the threshold that candidates needed to meet to enter their names into nomination  just as Ron Paul’s supporters were working to reach it  When John A  Boehner gaveled the rules in on a voice vote — a vote that many listeners heard as a tie  if not an outright loss — the hall erupted and a line of Ron Paul supporters walked off the floor in protest  along with many Tea Party members At a party meeting last winter  Reince Priebus  who as party chairman is charged with maintaining the support of all his constituencies  did restore some proportional primary and caucus voting  but only in states that held voting within a shortened two week window  And he also condensed the nominating schedule to four and a half months from six months  and  for the first time required candidates to participate in a shortened debate schedule  determined by the party  not by the whims of the networks   The panel that recommended those changes included names closely identified with the establishment — the former Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer  the Mississippi committeeman Haley Barbour and  notably  Jeb Bush’s closest adviser  Sally Bradshaw  Grass roots activists have complained that the condensed schedule robs nonestablishment candidates — “movement candidates” like Carson — of the extra time they need to build momentum  money and organizations  But Priebus  who says the nomination could be close to settled by April  said it helped all the party’s constituencies when the nominee was decided quickly  “We don’t need a six month slice and dice festival ” Priebus said when we spoke in mid March  “While I can’t always control everyone’s mouth  I can control how long we can kill each other ”All the rules changes were built to sidestep the problems of 2012  But the 2016 field is shaping up to be vastly different and far larger  A new Republican hints that he or she is considering a run seemingly every week  There are moderates like Gov  John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov  George Pataki of New York  no compromise conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania  business wingers like the former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina  one of a kinds like Donald Trump — some 20 in all  a dozen or so who seem fairly serious about it  That opens the possibility of multiple candidates vying for all the major Republican constituencies  some of them possibly goaded along by super PAC funding billionaires  all of them trading wins and collecting delegates well into spring Giles says his candidate can capitalize on all that chaos  Rivals may laugh  but Giles argues that if Carson can make a respectable showing in Iowa  then win in South Carolina — or at least come in second should a home state senator  Lindsey Graham  run — and come in second behind Bush or Senator Marco Rubio in their home state of Florida  he could be positioned to make a real run  But that would depend on avoiding pitfalls like Carson’s ill considered comments on homosexuality  Rather than capitalizing on the chaos  Carson may only contribute to it Ben Carson is  in many ways  the ideal Republican presidential candidate  With a not too selective reading of his life story  conservative voters can — and do — see in him an inspiring  up from nowhere African American who shares their beliefs  a right wing answer to Barack Obama  Before he was born  his parents moved to Detroit from rural Tennessee as part of the second great migration  His father  Robert Solomon Carson  worked at a Cadillac factory  His mother  Sonya — who herself had grown up as one of 24 children and left school at third grade — cleaned houses  When Carson was 8  Sonya discovered that Robert was keeping a second family  She moved  with her two sons  into a rundown group house  It was in a part of town that Carson described to me as crawling with “big rats and roaches and all kinds of horrible things ” Sonya worked several jobs at a time and made up the shortfall with food stamps   Carson has called for paring back the social safety net but not doing away with it  Carson recounts this story in his best selling 1990 memoir  “Gifted Hands ” which also became the basis for a 2009 movie on TNT  starring Cuba Gooding Jr  as Carson  Raised as a Seventh Day Adventist  Carson realized that he wanted to become a physician during a church sermon about a missionary doctor who  while serving overseas  was almost attacked by thieves but found safety by putting his faith in God  When Carson  then 8  told his mother his new dream  “She said  ‘Absolutely  you could do it  you could do anything ’ ” he told me  Forced by his mother to read two extra books a week  he made it to Yale  then to medical school at the University of Michigan  where he decided to specialize in neurosurgery  He was selected for residency at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center  where he was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at 33  becoming the youngest person  and the first black person  to hold the title  He drew national attention by conducting a succession of operations that had never been performed successfully  most famously planning and managing the first separation of conjoined twins connected through major blood vessels in the brain Carson  a two time Jimmy Carter voter  traces his conservative political awakening to a patient he met during the Reagan years  During a routine obstetrics rotation  he found himself treating an unwed pregnant teenager who had run away from her well to do parents  When Carson asked her how she was getting by  she informed him she was on public assistance  this led him to ponder the fact that the government was paying for the result of what he did not view as a “wise decision ” The incident  he says  fed his growing sense that the welfare system too often saps motivation and rewards irresponsible behavior   When we spoke  he suggested that the government should cut off assistance to would be unwed mothers  but only after warning them that it would do so within a certain amount of time  say five years  “I bet you’d see a dramatic decrease in unwed motherhood ” Carson’s friends at Hopkins say they do not remember him being particularly outspoken about his conservatism  He devoted most of his public engagement to urging poor kids in bad neighborhoods to use “these fancy brains God gave us ” through weekly school visits  student hospital tours and  ultimately  a multimillion dollar scholarship program  “His issues were always medical care for the poor  education for the poor  equal opportunity — helping the less fortunate and really inspiring them as an example ” a mentor who named him to the chief pediatrics neurosurgery post at Hopkins  Dr  Donlin Long  told me Even when Carson got the chance  in 1997  to speak in front of President Bill Clinton  at the national prayer breakfast  he mostly discussed the lack of role models for black children who were not sports stars or rappers   There was possibly an oblique reference to Clinton’s sex scandals  when he told the audience that  if they are always honest  they won’t have to worry later about “skeletons in the closet ” In 2011  Carson’s politics took a strident turn  mirroring that of many in his party during the Obama years  “America the Beautiful ” his sixth book  which he wrote with Candy Carson  his wife of 39 years  included a get tough on illegal immigration message and offered anti establishment praise for the Tea Party  It suggested that blacks who voted for Obama only because he was black were themselves practicing a form of racism   Earlier this year he admitted to Buzzfeed that portions of the book were lifted directly from several sources without proper attribution   His prayer breakfast performance in 2013  and the extremity of his remarks in the months afterward  Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery  the United States is “very much like Nazi Germany”  allowing same sex marriage could lead to allowing bestiality   left some of his old friends bewildered  Students at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine protested his planned convocation address there in 2013  and he eventually backed out  When I asked Carson about the view at Hopkins that he had changed  he said his themes are still the same  “hard work  self reliance  helping other people ” If he had become more overtly political  he said  it was only because the Obama years had led him to believe that “we’re really moving in a direction that is very  very destructive ”None of this went unnoticed by campaign professionals  In August 2013  John Philip Sousa IV and Vernon Robinson  each of whom professes to be a virtual stranger to Carson  and who had previously been active in the anti illegal immigration movement  started the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee  Sousa was just coming off a campaign to defend the sheriff of Maricopa County  Arizona  Joe Arpaio  from a recall effort  and he told me that he found Carson’s lack of political experience refreshing  “We have 500 guys and gals with probably a collective 5 000 years experience  and look at the mess we’re in ” he said Many others in the party feel the same way  Carson’s PAC finished 2014 with more than  13 million in donations  more than Ready for Hillary  Much of its money has gone toward further fund raising  but Sousa — the great grandson of the famous composer — points out that their effort has already built far more than just a war chest  organizing leaders in all 99 of Iowa’s counties  Regardless  Carson credits the fund raising success of Sousa and Robinson with persuading him to enter the race Very early the morning after the job interview  Carson was in a black S U V   heading from Washington to the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Oxon Hill  Md   where he was to give the opening candidate speech of the Conservative Political Action Conference  The event  which functions as an early tryout for Republican presidential contenders  tends to skew rightward in its audience  drawing many of the same sorts of people who shouted at Boehner in Tampa  As such  it tends to favor anti establishment candidates  but the news leading up to this year’s event was that Jeb Bush hoped to make inroads there It was still dark when we set out  and I joked with Carson about the hour  telling him he’d better get used to it  He retorted that his career in pediatric brain surgery made him no stranger to early mornings  This is a big theme of Carson’s presidential pitch  that neither the rigors of the campaign nor those of the White House can faze a man who held children’s lives in his hands  His life in brain surgery has prepared him for the presidency  he maintains  better than lives in politics have for his rivals  At the very least  he says  it conditioned him against getting too worked up about any problem that isn’t life threatening  “I mean  it’s grueling  but interestingly enough  I don’t feel the pressure ” he said At the convention hall  we were quickly surrounded by admirers  Two women were already waiting to meet him — white  middle aged volunteers for Carson’s super PAC  who had traveled from South Carolina  One of them  Chris Horne  was holding a dog eared and taped Bible  A founding member of the Charleston Tea Party who went on to work for Gingrich’s successful South Carolina primary campaign in 2012  Horne lamented over the attacks that Carson was sure to face  “You served us  you served the Lord  just don’t let them steal that from you ” she said  Her friend told him  “You’ve got God behind you ” Such religious evocations trailed Carson constantly while I walked the CPAC floor with him  Evangelicals are impressed not only with his devotion to their politics but also with his career path  as one of them told me  what’s more pro life than saving babies?During our ride to the conference  Carson told me his speech was not looking to “feed the beast ” When his appointed time came  he kept his remarks as tame as promised  “Real compassion” meant “using our intellect” to help people “climb out of dependency and realize the American dream ” he said  The national debt is going to “destroy us ” Obamacare was about “redistribution and control ” but Republicans better come forward with their own alternative before they repeal it  he said Because his speech was first  and it started several minutes early  the auditorium was slow to fill  Still  the first day saw a crush of people seeking autographs and pictures as he roamed the hall  The Draft Carson committee’s 150 volunteers swarmed the auditorium  collecting emails and handing out “Run Ben Run” stickers  After a quick interview with Sean Hannity  the conservative radio and Fox News host — his second in two days — Carson was off to Tampa In the hours that followed his talk  the hall offered a view in miniature of what the next 12 to 14 months might hold for the party  Chris Christie  sitting across from the tough minded talk radio host Laura Ingraham  boasted about his multiple vetoes of Planned Parenthood funding  his refusal to raise income taxes and his belief that “sometimes people need to be told to sit down and shut up ” Cruz  an audience favorite  warning his fellow Republicans against falling for a “squishy moderate ” declared  “Take all 125 000 I R S  agents and put ’em on our Southern border ” Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin  surging in polls  boasted that if he could face down the 100 000 union supporters who protested his legislation limiting collective bargaining for public employees  he could certainly handle ISIS  The next day  the traditional CPAC favorite Rand Paul spoke  packing the hall with his supporters who chanted “President Paul ” He warned  counter to the overall hawkish tenor of the event  that “we should not succumb to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow become successful abroad ” But he also vowed to end foreign aid to countries whose citizens are seen burning American flags  “Not one penny more to these haters of America ”Perhaps the defining moment came near the end of the conference  when Jeb Bush spoke  In a neat trick of political gamesmanship — and a show of establishment muscle — his team had bused in an ample cheering section for the dozens of cameras on hand for his appearance  But a small contingent of Tea Party activists and Rand Paul supporters staged a walk out  When Bush began a question and answer session  they turned and left the auditorium to chant “U S A   U S A ” in the hallway  led by a man in colonial garb waving a huge “Don’t Tread on Me” banner  Plenty of other detractors stayed in the hall and peppered Bush’s remarks with booing as he stood by positions unpopular with the conservative grass roots  support for the Common Core standards and an immigration overhaul that provides a “path to legal status” for undocumented immigrants  Bush took it all in good humor  but finally seemed to give up “For those who made an ‘oo’ sound — is that what it was? — I’m marking you down as neutral ” he said  “And I want to be your second choice ”Bush strategists told me they would not repeat Romney’s mistakes  Of course they would love to glide to an early nomination  they said  but they are prepared for a long contest and won’t be wasting any energy bending under pressure from a Paul or a Cruz or a Carson No one doubts that the pressure will increase  though  Despite the best wishes of the party’s leaders  GOP primary voters have given little indication that they will narrow the field quickly Before I left  I spotted Newt Gingrich  himself a fleeting presidential front runner during those strange primary days of 2012  I asked him whether he thought all the party maneuvering — all the attempts to change the rules and fast track the process — would preclude someone from presenting the sort of outside primary challenge he had carried out in the last election “No ” he told me  as if it was the most obvious thing in the world  “Look at where Ben Carson is right now ”","headline":{"main":"How

Observers disagree At MSNBC Alex Seitz Wald writes that this may have been Mr  Biden’s biggest gaffe yet  both for ruffling the feathers of important American allies in the Middle East and for the topic — foreign policy is supposed to be Mr  Biden’s domain “If he runs for president against Hillary Clinton in 2016  it will be on the strength of his foreign policy chops  which would allow him to present a credible alternative to Clinton’s more hawkish worldview ” writes Mr  Seitz Wald  But Mr  Biden “seems to have a constitutional inability to help himself ” and continues to undermine his substance Aaron Blake at The Washington Post calls Mr  Biden’s blunders a “long running subplot in Washington ” These gaffes paint a picture of someone who is careless with words  says Mr  Blake  “He has created an image of himself as a sort of un serious politician — a guy you’d like to have a beer with but wouldn’t trust to run your country ”While using offensive terms is bad  Mr  Blake says  he agrees with Mr  Seitz Wald that alienating American allies is serious  especially considering Mr  Biden’s foreign policy credentials At the same time  many have emphasized that what Mr  Biden said  was  in essence  the truth In the article “Joe Biden Is the Only Honest Man in Washington ” Gopal Ratnam writes for Foreign Policy that Mr  Biden’s comments may have been “impolitic” or “imprecise ” but “the substance of his remarks match up with what the U S  intelligence community has known for some time and has even publicly alluded to ”“What did they do?” Mr  Biden asked at Harvard  “They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad — except that the people who were being supplied were al Nusra and al Qaida and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world ”This was not incorrect  Mr  Ratnam writes  though perhaps not entirely accurate “There was certainly support for terror groups coming out of friendly countries in the region ” Jon Alterman  a global security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies  told Mr  Ratnam   One should not conclude from these comments that governments in the Middle East were directly supporting terrorists  “I don’t think that’s what he meant to say ” said Mr  Alterman  “The extent to which governments supported or condoned such support is unclear ”At The New York Times  Carol Giacomo says that Mr  Biden should have “exercised some restraint” and paused before sharing his conversation with Mr  Erdogan publicly  “But the basic truth — that Turkey and other countries enabled Islamic State and other extremists — can’t be wished away ”The United States and its Middle Eastern allies should cooperate to defeat ISIS  “That means owning up to the mistakes that have allowed the group to flourish and correcting them  including shutting down Turkey as a transit corridor for ISIS revenue  weapons and foreign fighters ” Ms  Giacomo writes The Boston Herald stands behind Mr  Biden in an editorial  Yes  he may be gaffe prone  but he “wasn’t wrong ” the Herald says “Yes  life in the region is complicated  And poor Joe  even when he’s right  he’s wrong ”","headline":{"main":"Joe Biden’s Latest Gaffe: the Truth or an Ultimate Embarrassment?

For me  it was his rally on Monday in Dallas  where he told an adoring crowd he was disgusted with what was happening to America  He called it “a dumping ground for the rest of the world ”The garbage he was referring to is people  the same kind of people we describe more poetically on a plaque at the foot of the Statue of Liberty Mr  Trump’s rivals are talking  in all seriousness  of undoing the Constitution and building a border wall  A Fox News host compares immigration to “a tumor or a disease ” Two young thugs in Boston attack and urinate on a homeless Latino man  saying Mr  Trump inspired them  A Trump supporter outside the Dallas rally grabs a microphone and yells at anti Trump protesters  “Clean my hotel room  bitch ” Another  referring to Mr  Trump’s mass deportation plan  says  “This isn’t going to be painless  They’ve been inflicting pain on us for 20 years ”It’s not clear that Mr  Trump will end up with any power to pursue his racist agenda — his ambitions seem a lot narrower  more TV based  But the toxic support he is stirring up  the polluted ideas he is spreading  the hate he is emboldening his supporters to voice with his blaring  surround sound campaign — that evil will live after him  We will be cleaning up after Mr  Trump for a long time Vice President Joe Biden spoke reassuringly to a Latino group on Tuesday  saying that Mr  Trump and his fellow Republicans were taking pages from an old playbook that always fails “This will pass ” he said  This “sick message” has been tried on America before  and we always — “always  always  always  always” — overcome it Yes  we do  but it keeps coming back  and keeps doing damage I think of some recent examples  close to home Long Island  where I live  has been transformed in recent years  like many other American suburbs  by an influx of Latino immigrants  The demographics of Long Island’s two counties  Nassau and Suffolk  are similar  But where Nassau had a cool  pragmatic county executive  who talked of unity and sensible solutions  Suffolk had a county executive who liked to blame immigrants for overburdened housing  schools and hospitals  and for supposedly lawless acts like gathering on sidewalks to look for work  His words inflamed and incited community passions  his claims that immigrants were a blight on the county found a receptive audience And Suffolk  not Nassau  became nationally notorious for repeated attacks on Latino immigrants  including one horrific murder  Even the county police department was accused of patterns of racial abuse  Other politicians have risen to power in communities where people feel uneasy and resentful and are looking for a target for their anger  Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County  Ariz   has perennially been elected despite — or rather because of — his history of oppressing Latinos in his jurisdiction Mr  Trump has made the nativists restless  on a national scale  Those in media and entertainment who are distracted by his comedic potential are missing the point  Jimmy Fallon  doing a skit with Mr  Trump  normalizes his toxic message  with giggles   I’m hoping that Stephen Colbert  who has Mr  Trump on his show next week  will do better at avoiding this moral trap  but I’m not holding my breath  The Trump effect leads to a question I’ve been pondering  Is politics like physics  where adding gas to a container creates pressure and heat? If you keep pumping inflammatory speech into the public discourse  do you eventually get ignition?","headline":{"main":"The Real Danger of Donald Trump","kicker":"Taking Note"},"wordCount":"835"},

didn’t know that seamstress was among them There were moments in the first Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night when she threaded the needle as delicately and perfectly as a politician could The debate’s moderator  Anderson Cooper  noted that she’d told some audiences that she was a progressive but extolled her moderation in front of others  Wasn’t she just a chameleon  flashing whatever colors suited her at a given moment?“I’m a progressive  but I’m a progressive who likes to get things done ” she said strongly but not stridently  “I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground ” It was a practiced line — so practiced that she used it  somewhat awkwardly  a second time an hour later  But it was also a well crafted line Like her main rival onstage  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  she had complaints about our country  Unlike Sanders  she communicated an unshakable pride in it nonetheless Sanders said America should look to Denmark  Clinton countered  “We are not Denmark  I love Denmark  We are the United States of America ”Even when she was confronted anew by her vote in the Senate long ago to authorize the invasion of Iraq  she was neither defiant nor apologetic  steering a smooth midcourse by recalling that at debates in 2008  Barack Obama had attacked her for that  “After the election ” she pointed out  “he asked me to become secretary of state  He valued my judgment ”The subject of Iraq caused her less grief than Sanders suffered on gun control  when not only Clinton but also Martin O’Malley  the former Maryland governor  rejected his explanation of votes in the Senate against various bills and his insistence that he was representing rural areas with gun cultures  not a nationwide electorate  It was clumsy because he presents himself as a creature of pure principle  immune to political convenience But on Tuesday night an odd sort of role reversal occurred  For much of the debate  Sanders somehow came across as the embattled incumbent  targeted by the other four candidates  while Clinton came across as the energetic upstart He seemed bowed  irascible  She seemed buoyant  effervescent  It was as poised a performance as she’s finessed in a long time  and while I’ve just about given up making predictions about this confounding election — I never thought Donald Trump would last so long  and I never saw Ben Carson coming — I think Clinton benefited more from Tuesday’s stage than Sanders did She mixed confidence and moments of passion with instances of humor  and her manner was less didactic and robotic than it can often be  From Cooper and from the four men bookending her at the lecterns  she had everything thrown at her  Iraq  Benghazi  her coziness with Wall Street  her personal wealth But she was seldom rattled  though the discussion of her use of a home brewed server for her emails as secretary of state did prompt a visible stiffening of her posture  a conspicuous strain in her smile  Will she ever  ever find language that takes full ownership of her mistake and that puts real flesh on her continued claim that she’s being as transparent as possible?It was possibly her worst moment It was perhaps Sanders’s best  Surprisingly  he called for an end to talk about the emails  saying there were more important issues to focus on  High mindedness met unusual campaign trail generosity and gallantry  Clinton laughed and beamed  They shook hands  and I half expected a hug The debate isn’t going to change the fortunes of Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb  who were at the edges of the stage and will remain on the edges of the race  O’Malley might benefit an iota  and grew bolder as the night progressed Sanders grew redundant  returning with questionable frequency to a single issue — greed and income inequality — that made him sound like a one note candidate  He’s 100 percent right to question corporations and trumpet the plight of the middle class  But he does so as more of a firebrand  calling for a “political revolution ” than as someone who can be trusted to make meaningful progress Clinton had her own redundancies  saying twice if not thrice as often as was necessary that she’d be the first female president  She’s gone from sidestepping her gender in 2008 to roaring about it now Apart from that  she was mum when silence served her best and fiery when that was the right call — for instance  when she vowed to “take the fight to the Republicans ”And she benefited from the visual contrast when she stood side by side on TV next to Sanders  with his slight hunch  his somewhat garbled style of speech  and a moment when he cupped his hand behind his ear  signaling that he hadn’t heard the question He evoked yesterday  Despite many decades in the political trenches  she didn’t  It was a nifty trick  Turns out she’s a bit of a sorceress as well ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton’s Democratic Debate Magic","content_kicker":"Op-Ed

Republican presidential debates  America’s moral core is rotting  its citizens tolerating rampant abortions and even the dissection of fetuses for profit In the alternate reality described at Tuesday’s Democratic debate  counteracting climate change and protecting African Americans from police shootings are the most pressing moral imperatives Republican candidates say capitalism is buckling under high taxes  regulations and social welfare programs  Democrats question capitalism itself  saying Wall Street and the super rich are starving the middle class of hope The right has portrayed the southern border as something like a zombie movie  swarming with murderous Mexicans  On the left  illegal immigrants look like hard workers who deserve a path to citizenship One of the most striking takeaways from the first two Republican debates and Tuesday’s first Democratic debate is that the two parties do not just disagree on solutions to domestic and foreign policy issues — they do not even agree on what the issues are  Offering radically different assessments of the challenges people face  and diametrically opposing policy agendas  the candidates could have been campaigning on different continents Hillary Rodham Clinton  a Democrat  described gun violence as a scourge that required tough government actions  like background checks and new restrictions on purchases  Jeb Bush  a Republican  framed gun violence as resulting from fractured families and weak sentencing laws  Democrats talked about criminal justice  Republicans dwelled on what they called the criminalization of a Christian county clerk who took a stand against same sex marriage “The parties are definitely not talking about the same United States  which is really nuts  given that voters are so desperate for big solutions that will bring the nation together ” said Christopher Durang  a playwright who specializes in political absurdism and social satire  “You have Carly Fiorina still insisting that videos show babies being carved up  even though this has been disproved  You have the Democrats suggesting that people are doing well but could do better  when a lot of people feel they aren’t doing well at all  You just wonder what country all these candidates live in ”The jumble of policy differences and priorities reflects the lack of a single dominant issue galvanizing both parties in the 2016 race  The economy was the overriding issue in the presidential elections of 1992  2008  and 2012  which Democrats won  The Iraq war was the fulcrum in 2004  when George W  Bush was re elected  The 1996 and 2000 campaigns were largely referendums on Bill Clinton  a strengthening economy and a stolid Republican opponent helped him win re election  while his vice president  Al Gore  struggled in 2000 to embrace Mr  Clinton’s economic record but disown the scandal that threatened his presidency This time around  there is a political vacuum to fill  With no dominant issue to run on or against  and no incumbent seeking re election  the candidates must first persuade voters to accept their diagnoses before selling them on their prescriptions On foreign policy  for instance  Republican contenders portray the United States as a weakling in the eyes of Russia’s president  Vladimir V  Putin  though they do not have clear strategies for dealing with him beyond tough talk or the silent treatment   Democrats see Mr  Putin as overcompensating  exerting military might in Syria to save face for Russia’s poor economy and misadventures elsewhere  but they  too  are torn  Mrs  Clinton said she would confront him like a bully  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would wait for Russians to grow angry at Mr  Putin over their battlefield casualties  “Given that the Republicans are the party out of power and lack a single major issue  they are casting around for domestic problems and global threats to energize their voters and build enough support to win back the White House ” said Linda L  Fowler  a professor of government at Dartmouth who studies political leadership This challenge is exacerbated by the size of the Republican field  with 15 candidates  she said “With so many people  voters can’t easily make sense of the complicated political world ” Ms  Fowler said  “So the Republicans try to stand out with sharply worded sound bites because those are more memorable — even if they create more of a divide between candidates and parties ”The tone of the two parties’ candidates is sharply at odds  too  Democrats on Tuesday were more optimistic  talking of clean

future ” He said Republicans were more critical of one another “As of now  the Democrats are set to emerge from the primaries far more unified ” Mr  Luntz said  “If anything  the Democratic debate

support in the polls than Bernie Sanders and hasn’t raised a single dollar for a presidential campaign  Yet if Mr  Biden does decide to seek the presidency  he will pose a greater challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination In Mr  Biden  Mrs  Clinton would have an opponent who could threaten her hold on the coalition of moderate voters and party elites that seems to have the advantage in this race over the party’s white  liberal activist wing  which now supports Mr  Sanders Mrs  Clinton would remain a clear favorite even if Mr  Biden ran  But unlike Mr  Sanders  the Vermont senator who has made gains largely by winning over those already inclined to be unhappy with Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Biden would have strength that would come almost exclusively at her expense According to polls from the last month  Mrs  Clinton is the second choice of nearly all of Mr  Biden’s supporters  His growing strength since July  when he began to flirt with another presidential run and when scrutiny intensified over the private email account Mrs  Clinton used while secretary of state  is largely responsible for her decline in the polls If he stays out of the race  Mrs  Clinton retakes a commanding lead of 57 percent to 31 percent over Mr  Sanders  in an average of seven national surveys  Those same surveys show Mrs  Clinton leading Mr  Sanders by a smaller margin  44 percent to 27 percent  with Mr  Biden in the race  Mrs  Clinton picks up 13 points without Mr  Biden  while Mr  Sanders picks up just 4 points The notion that Mr  Biden’s supporters overwhelmingly prefer Mrs  Clinton to Mr  Sanders might be surprising if the Biden or Sanders supporters were to be considered “anyone but Clinton” voters  But like Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Biden is a mainstream  establishment Democrat  His supporters are demographically much like her supporters Without him in the race  she could unite the coalition of older  moderate and nonwhite voters that has traditionally driven an establishment Democrat to win the nomination  It’s essentially Mrs  Clinton’s 2008 coalition  with the addition of black voters  And black voters have generally supported moderate  establishment candidates  Al Gore over Bill Bradley  Bill Clinton over Paul Tsongas  Walter Mondale over Gary Hart   except when a black candidate  like Barack Obama or Jesse Jackson  has also sought the presidency This coalition would easily be enough of a base for Mrs  Clinton to win the nomination  even if it left her in close races or with losses in states where white progressives play an outsize role in a Democratic primary or caucus  like Iowa or New Hampshire Among nonwhite voters  she leads Mr  Sanders in a one on one contest by a huge margin of 71 percent to 16 percent Similarly  she leads among moderate voters by a margin of 63 to 23 points  The race is closer among whites and liberals  but she still takes a slight lead among both groups in a head to head contest with Mr  Sanders Mr  Sanders said earlier this year that he thought he had a chance to break into Mrs  Clinton’s coalition by winning support from working class voters  Perhaps he can  But his opponent is a candidate with universal name recognition  tremendous backing from party elites and considerable financial and organizational resources  These factors make her far less vulnerable than other candidates to perceptions of momentum — in which voters who don’t follow the campaign very closely can flock to someone who seems to be gaining She proved that durability in 2008  when she ultimately fought Mr  Obama to an effective tie after his victory in Iowa and after his long string of victories following Super Tuesday These powerful structural advantages give Mrs  Clinton the upper hand over Mr  Sanders  and it’s hard to see her losing that Mrs  Clinton would still be  by any measure  the candidate in the best position to win the nomination  She also has an advantage over Mr  Biden across every dimension of primary strength  She has more endorsements  fund raising and elite support  She leads him in every poll  in every state  across every demographic group  At the moment  the likeliest outcome would be that Mr  Biden wins zero states There are few reasons to believe that Mr  Biden is such a compelling political figure that he could simply snatch away Mrs  Clinton’s coalition  He twice ran for the presidency with little success  He was vice president for eight years  but there was not a groundswell of support for him to join the race  He may be riding high in recent polls  but sustaining high favorability ratings after jumping into the fray and becoming a more politicized figure could very well be a different story  He would face attacks about his long and often fairly moderate record in the Senate  on issues like crime  finance or Iraq The challenge is even greater because Mr  Sanders has already consolidated much of Mrs  Clinton’s natural opposition  and it is a stretch to suggest that Mr  Biden — an establishment Democrat with a record not that different from Mrs  Clinton’s — would have a real chance of peeling away Mr  Sanders’s enthusiastic and loyal supporters But unlike Mr  Sanders  Mr  Biden is acceptable to party elites  and nearly all Democratic voters see him as “electable ” He is well known and liked by less educated and more moderate Democrats  and his relationship to Mr  Obama could ultimately help among black voters as well If Mrs  Clinton faltered  which is imaginable as long as the email controversy lingers  Mr  Biden would be poised to capitalize  Just as Mrs  Clinton is the second choice of Biden supporters  Mr  Biden is the second choice of Clinton supporters The scenario in which Mrs  Clinton implodes and leaves Mr  Biden to a one on one contest with Mr  Sanders is unlikely  But Mr  Biden would be the favorite in that event  even if he had to make up ground against Mr  Sanders in fund raising and organization  A YouGov poll showed Mr  Biden leading Mr  Sanders by a 58 to 42 margin in a one on one contest — even though he would trail Mr  Sanders in a three way race — by claiming most of Mrs  Clinton’s support among older and nonwhite voters A more likely possibility than a Clinton implosion is that she has been more deeply damaged by the email controversy than currently believed or will be hurt by future developments  In that case  Mr  Biden’s presence would allow Democratic elites to bail out on her  rather than trying to shore up her campaign  knowing they had an acceptable and electable alternative Mrs  Clinton would still be very difficult to defeat  thanks to her substantial resources and strong base  and it could lead to something like a true three way race  Even if Mr  Biden couldn’t ultimately defeat Mrs  Clinton  he would make her path to victory much longer Perhaps the best case for Mr  Sanders involves a protracted and close Clinton Biden fight  in which neither Mrs  Clinton nor Mr  Biden can consolidate the establishment or the moderate vote  and neither candidate is compelled to back down  Mr  Sanders’s 30 percent or 40 percent of the Democratic coalition will go a lot further if Mr  Biden and Mrs  Clinton split the rest  The longer such a contest went on  the more plausible it would become for Mr  Sanders to squeak out a plurality victory  It’s a long shot  but it can’t be ruled out What we know for sure is that Mrs  Clinton would start a three way race with a big edge  and that Mr  Biden is the type of candidate who would have a chance of taking that advantage for himself if she ran into more trouble  And if he doesn’t run? She goes back to being an overwhelming favorite for the nomination  His decision is easily the most important political story of the moment ","headline":{"main":"Joe Biden: No Money, Weak Polls, but Still Clinton’s Toughest Rival","content_kicker":"Political Calculus","kicker":"The Upshot","print_headline":"Biden, Despite Weak Poll Numbers, Is Still Clinton’s Toughest Rival"},"wordCount":"1315"},

Monday morning  The House is bracing for a leadership fight this week  and the Supreme Court returns  But the focus will shift more to the Democrats as they prepare for their first debate next week and as Hillary Rodham Clinton is rolling out new proposals and a strategy to highlight her organizational and structural advantages  even while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont continues to dog her in the polls With the summer behind them  Mrs  Clinton’s campaign aides on Monday will announce a series of “leadership councils” in crucial March states  the latest effort to create an engaged network of organizers At almost every turn  Mrs  Clinton uses her stump speeches to describe the importance of organizing  the absence of which played a role in her not winning the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination  Her team had planned for weeks to unveil councils in crucial states — the first being Colorado  Minnesota and Virginia — as the fall push in the Democratic nominating contest began But the leadership councils comprise dozens of top elected officials and superdelegates in those states  who will be asked to help target new volunteers and supporters  and who serve as surrogates in the news media in their states  The numbers make clear the work that Mrs  Clinton’s allies have put in since 2013 to bolster her prospects The leadership councils will eventually be in all 50 states  a campaign aide said  And as with the Clinton campaign’s donor structure  the goal is “flat” — meaning the top elected official isn’t the leader of the group Many of the people on the lists — such as Gov  Terry McAuliffe of Virginia  a friend of the Clintons and the chairman of Mrs  Clinton’s last presidential campaign — long ago endorsed her  before she was actually a candidate  and when the “super PAC” Ready for Hillary was trying to stockpile endorsements  But in some cases  it’s the first time those endorsers have had a role in her campaign And they serve as a reminder that large sections of the Democratic establishment have already committed to Mrs  Clinton  at a moment when Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  is testing how much room remains for him to join the race – Maggie HabermanWhat We’re Watching This Week–  Mrs  Clinton will hold town hall style events in New Hampshire on Monday and will be in Iowa on Tuesday –  Mr  Sanders will be in Washington through Thursday  and he will hold an event in Arizona  where in July he drew a crowd of more than 11 000  Martin O’Malley will be in Nevada –  Among the Republicans  Jeb Bush and Donald J  Trump have events in Iowa  and Carly Fiorina in New Hampshire  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will be in New York and New Hampshire House Republicans Brace for a Crowded Leadership RaceIt is a defining week for House Republicans  who find themselves in turmoil after the announced departure of Speaker John A  Boehner at the end of the month Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah further roiled the picture on Sunday when he announced he would run for speaker and try to mount a credible challenge to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  currently the majority leader and No  2 Republican Mr  Chaffetz  the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee  is positioning himself as an alternative to the status quo and as a man able to bridge the divide that led to Mr  Boehner’s departure — the gap between mainstream Republicans and a segment of House conservatives who want a more confrontational approach to both President Obama and the Republican controlled Senate Leadership candidates will be campaigning in advance of Thursday  when Republican are to choose their speaker candidate and fill other vacancies  But House conservatives are pushing for a delay in any subsequent vote for majority leader and whip  and the idea is getting some consideration  Some lawmakers also want those running for a higher position to give up their current leadership slots  At the same time  leadership allies want to impose new rules to punish lawmakers who vote against the party’s candidate for speaker on the House floor this month The exercise is turning into a very public soul searching for House Republicans  And it mirrors the Republican presidential campaign trail  where outsiders like Mr  Trump and Mrs  Fiorina have vaulted ahead of established office holders  propelled by grass roots activists clamoring for new faces — Carl HulseSupreme Court Returns With an Eye OverseasThe first Supreme Court argument of the new term  which starts on Monday  concerns a terrible

company may be sued in connection with what is said to be an international drug and money laundering conspiracy spanning Afghanistan  Colombia  the Middle East and Russia “The Supreme Court must increasingly consider the world beyond our national frontiers ” Justice Breyer said last month  The new term’s docket suggests that he is right — Adam LiptakOur Favorites From the Times— With Mr

is an issue that is sure to come up in next week’s debate  as Mr  Sanders has shown some vulnerability on the issue  and Mr  O’Malley has criticized them both for their stands in the past and called on them to support his proposals — Candidates are accelerating their efforts in Iowa to win former supporters of Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin — Mr  Trump sounded uncharacteristically resigned on

momentum stalling  two candidates quitting  and Kentucky Sen  Rand Paul’s campaign collapsing ”— And in an NBC News Wall Street Journal poll  NBC News reports  Mr  Trump maintains his lead  but he has

activist wing and the donor class of the Democratic Party like the regulation of Wall Street The desire to assail too big to fail banks energizes the left and has propelled Senator Elizabeth Warren and the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders  But some of the party’s most prodigious donors come from the financial industry and don’t much care for its vilification  And Bill Clinton’s administration oversaw the deregulation on Wall Street All that makes the question of how Hillary Clinton would regulate the financial sector a crucial test of her campaign to win the Democratic nomination  With a plan she released Thursday  we got a first glimpse of how she would walk that balance beam The short version  Directionally  Mrs  Clinton favors more intensive regulation of Wall Street than what is in place now  Bank executives and lobbyists will find little to like in her plan  But her approach stops short of the wholesale breakup of too big to fail banks favored by Mr  Sanders and Mrs  Warren  She would prefer instead to take the philosophical approach embodied in the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform act a few steps further Mrs  Clinton proposes changes that would put stiff new costs on the largest banks and give regulators greater power to break up an institution they view as too sprawling and risky  But her plan does not envision a return to the era of the Glass Steagall Act  the 1930s law requiring commercial banking and investment banking to remain separate  It was reversed by Congress during the Bill Clinton administration  an action that had less to do with the global financial crisis than many liberal activists would suggest  Rather  her plan focuses on a series of changes to incentivize the biggest banks to shrink and simplify  It looks to reform markets that may be obscure to the general public but were actually key nodes in the 2008 global financial crisis  In particular  it concentrates on the multi trillion dollar securities lending and repurchase market  which is a crucial piece of the world’s financial plumbing The Dodd Frank law gave regulators a broad range of powers to oversee “systemically important” institutions  Combined with new international capital rules and more aggressive enforcement of corporate lawbreaking  it has made it more expensive than ever to be a sprawling global megabank  Giant banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were left to decide on their own whether to respond to those costs by slimming down  such as by selling or shutting down business units If Mrs  Clinton is elected president and gets her way — some of her ideas could be executed through regulatory fiat  others would require legislation — the incentive to slim down would be that much greater Here are the key elements of her plan A new “risk fee” on the largest financial firms  The biggest banks  insurers and other mega financial firms already face greater oversight than their smaller rivals under the Dodd Frank Act  Mrs  Clinton proposes taking that notion a step further by requiring a significant new fee  payable to the United States Treasury  for those very large firms that are potentially risky  Interestingly  its level is not determined by the size of a firm per se  but by the amount it relies upon volatile short term funding to finance its operations So  for example  Wells Fargo has about twice the assets of Goldman Sachs  but primarily funds itself with bank deposits and engages in relatively plain consumer and business lending  A more complex firm like Goldman  which relies more heavily on fast moving capital markets for funding  would thus have more to fear from the risk fee Mrs  Clinton’s proposal does not detail the exact scale or structure of the fee  which would require legislation  She envisions it as being substantial enough to have a meaningful impact on banks’ decision making  In other words  billions  not millions  of dollars Give regulators more power to break up financial firms  For all the discussion of whether to break up the too big to fail banks in recent years  the actual legal tools that regulators have to do so are limited  Mrs  Clinton proposes granting regulators more explicit power to demand a firm downsize or break up  A campaign fact sheet adds that Mrs  Clinton “would appoint regulators who would both use these new authorities and the substantial authorities they already have to hold firms accountable ”Dodd Frank requires that major banks prepare “living wills” that describe the legal details of how they would be unwound in the event of a failure  But this proposed legislation would instead grant regulators more power to determine that  for example  a bank that had repeated major ethics scandals might just be too sprawling and complex to manage and therefore could endanger financial stability Regulate “shadow banking” more intensively  While the public debate about financial reform has concentrated on the too big to fail banks  in many ways a bigger driver of the 2008 financial crisis was the “shadow banking” sector — segments of the financial system that resemble banks in important ways but are not regulated like them  It includes money market mutual funds  hedge funds and some parts of the insurance industry Her plans for addressing risks in those segments of the shadow banking system are still relatively vague  but she has more specifics on the securities lending and repurchase system  which was a key channel through which the failure of Lehman Brothers and near failure of the insurer A I G  endangered the global financial system in 2008 Mrs  Clinton calls for new international rules governing disclosure  margin and collateral requirements to try to make a failure of one global bank or insurer less likely to endanger the entire world economy  These are changes that are likely to take place through regulatory action rather than legislation With the first Democratic debate taking place next week  the stage is set for financial reform to be a major area where Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders can clash ","headline":{"main":"How Hillary Clinton Would Regulate Wall

Wednesday morning  The fate of the nuclear deal with Iran was high on the to do list of lawmakers returning from vacation  But on Wednesday  the debate leaps to the front of the campaign trail as

the “catastrophic” deal Mrs  Clinton will give a sweeping speech in Washington on Wednesday on the Iran nuclear deal — the seeds of which were sown while she was secretary of state — and will call for measures “deterring Iran and its proxies ” bolstering allies in the region  and strengthening enforcement to ensure the accord works According to excerpts from her speech released by her campaign on Tuesday evening  Mrs  Clinton plans to say that she supports the deal “as part of a larger strategy toward Iran ”“We need to be clear eyed about what we can expect from Iran ” Mrs  Clinton is expected

to its defense systems  as well as finding new ways to cut off lifelines to Hezbollah  a militant group in Lebanon with close ties to Iran  She will also call for other enforcement measures  including closely monitoring human rights abuses and other offenses For Mrs  Clinton  backing the deal comes with the risk of angering some of her more conservative supporters of Israel who have opposed the accord  and some of her major donors  But the talks that led to the agreement began under her watch  when she dispatched Jake Sullivan  now her campaign policy adviser  to Oman for secret negotiations

{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/technology/politicians-turn-to-start-ups-for-grasp-of-gig-economy.html","date":"2015-10-05T00:00:00Z","content":"SAN FRANCISCO —  Marco Zappacosta runs an Internet start up called Thumbtack that matches plumbers  yoga instructors and other workers with jobs  putting him in the middle of what is called the “gig economy ” Now  that position has made him in demand with a group of political power players Last week  Mr  Zappacosta traded emails with Senator Mark R  Warner  Democrat of Virginia  who wanted to talk about how tech companies were changing the nature of work  In July  the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush visited Thumbtack in San Francisco to discuss the gig economy and small businesses  In January  Mr  Zappacosta took dozens of the housecleaners  caterers and movers who use Thumbtack to the White House to talk with the Small Business Administration “I never had the expectation that senators and presidential hopefuls would want my views ” said Mr  Zappacosta  30  who helped found Thumbtack six years ago Thumbtack is one of several start ups that are being drawn into the debate over the future of work by politicians and policy makers  With the approach of an election year in which income inequality is expected to be fiercely debated  the security — or lack of security — that these types of jobs provide has become a central issue Many of today’s technology start ups are enabling people to try to make a living by fulfilling one time tasks or doing freelance work  fueling the rise of the gig economy  The trend is exemplified by Uber  the giant ride hailing company  which directly employs about 4 000 people but has more than 160 000 drivers in the United States who depend on it for at least part of their livelihood Politicians are seeking out start ups like Thumbtack to learn more about how they work  especially because their business models represent a counterpoint to Uber’s While Uber requires drivers to use its app to find passengers for rides  for example  Thumbtack merely arranges an introduction between a worker and a job — the relationship is maintained outside the company  Other start ups that have been approached by politicians include Munchery  a food delivery company that employs its chefs and drivers  and Managed by Q  an on demand office maintenance service that also has full time workers   By contrast  Uber drivers are classified as independent contractors  “We create numerous jobs in every market we’re in ” said Tri Tran  chief executive of Munchery  which hosted Hillary Rodham Clinton  a Democratic candidate for president  in August for a conversation with tech start ups including Shyp  Instacart and Uber  “Uber and Airbnb create a massive amount of jobs in different ways  When that happens  policy makers have to pay attention ”An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment A recent study commissioned in part by the Freelancers Union estimates that about one third of the work force  or 53 7 million people  now do freelance work  an increase of 700 000 from a year earlier  Nearly three quarters of the freelancers surveyed agreed that technology was making it easier to find work Many policy makers are only now catching up to the implications of the trend  Even though many start ups that have pioneered more flexible work arrangements began operating in 2009 and 2010  lawmakers did not start to pay attention to them until Uber ran into legal trouble over whether its drivers should be defined as employees  according to Arun Sundararajan  professor of information  operations and management sciences at New York University  Uber says its drivers are contractors  That means the company does not need to pay them benefits “This time last year few politicians were paying attention to the work force that powers these start ups  and now they’re trying to figure out how to protect them ” Professor Sundararajan said That legal strife has since prompted a stream of policy makers and politicians to visit start up executives in Silicon Valley  and tech leaders to head to Washington to discuss worker protections and classifications David Kochel  the chief strategist for Mr  Bush  said the candidate was reaching out to start ups because “the gig economy is transforming the way we think of work ”“You have to be on the ground to understand what’s happening ” he said Start up executives say they have pushed politicians to be more proactive on the topic of the future of work  When Mrs  Clinton visited Munchery  for example  Mr  Tran said  he urged her to be a “leader” on the issue “Whether or not she becomes the next president  she’s in a position to influence policy makers and champion the ways that mobile devices and technology are coming up with new ways to offer flexible job opportunities ” he said A spokesman for Mrs  Clinton said she had visited Munchery to understand better how to support entrepreneurship Last month  Mr  Warner also visited several Silicon Valley companies  including Lyft and Airbnb  to talk about the future of labor  Coming up with parameters to deal with the shifting nature of work “is too important to leave to the courts alone ” he said in an interview  He added that he was worried the United States could end up with a patchwork of state laws that provide uneven protection for workers “There’s just a lot of pressure to not screw it up when it comes to labor policies that have evolved over a century and impact millions of people ” said Dan Teran  the co founder of Managed by Q  who has been having regular conversations with state and local politicians in New York  where his company is based  Mr  Teran  whose company classifies workers as employees and provides benefits including health care  will take part in a White House conference on workers on Wednesday For Thumbtack  it became natural to forge ties with Washington as the future of work has grown into a larger debate  The company  which has 350 employees  has raised about  273 million and is valued at nearly  1 3 billion  has several executives who have worked as White House staff members and interns Just last week  Thumbtack’s chief economist  Jon Lieber  who was the associate director of the National Economic Council during the administration of President George W  Bush  testified before a House subcommittee at a hearing called “The Disrupter Series  How the Sharing Economy Creates Jobs  Benefits Consumers and Raises Policy Questions ”Mr  Zappacosta said start ups were becoming more interested in politics generally as they begin to engage in issues like employment laws  He said he had participated in panels where start ups were pushing lawmakers to take a more complete view of what it means to freelance  some want lawmakers to create a new worker classification that better describes the jobs offered by some companies that fall somewhere between full time employment and independent contracting The ways these start ups are changing work “isn’t just about the gig economy ” Mr  Zappacosta said  “This is about the whole economy ”","headline":{"main":"Politicians Turn to Start-Ups

system hijacked by billionaires and special interests ” Hillary Rodham Clinton presented a set of proposals on Tuesday to curb anonymous political donations and bolster the influence of small donors through a federal matching program “Our democracy should be about expanding the franchise  not charging an entrance fee ” Mrs  Clinton said in a statement  reiterating her call to overturn the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling The issue of campaign finance reform has galvanized voters in both parties amid a roiling debate about what democracy means in an era when “super PACs” can raise and spend billions in support of candidates  Two candidates — Donald J  Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — have struck a chord by railing against the influence of such groups in politics Mrs  Clinton’s multiprong plan includes a push for legislation that would require greater public disclosure of political spending  establish a matching system for congressional and presidential candidates  and support a Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose political spending to shareholders Mr  Sanders has  in his calls for reform  rejected money from super PACs and relied on low dollar online donations  Mr  Trump has accused his Republican rivals of being captive to billionaire donors Other candidates  like Senator Rand Paul  Republican of Kentucky  and former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  a Democrat  have also called for campaign finance reform Lawrence Lessig  a Harvard professor  said Sunday that he would enter the Democratic race for president on that single issue Mrs  Clinton’s plan  announced as polls show a rising threat from Mr  Sanders in New Hampshire  amounts to a wish list of ideas long advocated by critics of big money in politics  none of them elaborated in great detail For example  she proposed to match contributions by small donors with additional taxpayer funds  which would in theory diminish the influence of big donors by enhancing the collective financial clout of small ones  Her campaign did not offer many specifics for such a system  such as the amount of the match or — more crucially for critics — what such a program might cost Mrs  Clinton’s announcement was hailed by supporters of tighter financial rules for candidates  who have struggled to make political money a burning campaign issue despite surveys showing widespread disgust with existing rules “What she has proposed is both good policy and good politics ” said David Donnelly  the president of Every Voice  a Washington group that supports tougher campaign finance and influence peddling restrictions  “That’s why Clinton should actively campaign on this platform and push these solutions to the center of the debate in the days  weeks and months to come ”Mrs  Clinton’s efforts to address the issue come even as she works to help Priorities USA Action  the main super PAC supporting her candidacy  raise hundreds of millions of dollars to compete with Republican groups that have far outraised their Democratic counterparts  Last month  Priorities said it had secured  20 5 million in commitments since July Republican critics were quick to call Mrs  Clinton’s plan hypocritical  “Hillary Clinton stopped making calls to her own super PAC donors long enough to call for an end to super PACs ” said Jeff Bechdel  a spokesman for America Rising  a conservative super PAC But Democrats say forgoing super PAC money would be tantamount to handing the election to Republicans  erasing any chance for reform To that end  Mrs  Clinton frequently tells donors that the only way to enact her plan and reform the system is to elect a Democrat  President Obama used a similar argument in his 2012 re election fight  which relied heavily on the support of Priorities USA Action Mrs  Clinton said she would support new disclosure legislation  seeking to unearth the hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money that flows through business trade groups and nonprofits  neither of which must disclose donors  She also backs a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose political activity She said she would also sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to fully disclose all political spending But each proposal has run into fierce resistance from Republicans and business groups  Shareholder activists and labor unions have been pushing for the S E C  rule for more than two years  Republicans have filibustered a legislative approach  known as the Disclose Act  offered by Democrats  Congressional Republicans also included a rider in a recent spending bill aimed at staving off a disclosure rule for federal contractors  something President Obama has signaled in the past that he might issue It was during Mrs  Clinton’s last run for president  in 2008  that the conservative group Citizens United tried to stop her with a critical documentary that led to the Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for super PACs Mrs  Clinton has recently started to remind voters of this personal connection to the case and the cause  “They took aim at me  but they ended up damaging our entire democracy ” she said at a Democratic dinner in Iowa last month  her voice breaking after delivering a fiery partisan speech  “We can’t let them pull that same trick again ”Mrs  Clinton’s refrain that she would push for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling has been met with particular skepticism “A lot of folks read today’s announcement  and with all due respect to the secretary and her team  90 percent of those things aren’t going to happen anytime soon ” said Robert J  Jackson Jr   a law professor at Columbia who has advised Mrs  Clinton in the past  He added that the rule requiring disclosure by publicly traded companies seemed particularly doable and potentially effective Mrs  Clinton’s embrace of campaign finance reform might not only help her shore up support among liberals who are increasingly captivated by Mr  Sanders  but also help her and her husband  former President Bill Clinton  shed their image as overly cozy with the donor class  In recent years  the Clintons have come under criticism for their paid speeches to Wall Street banks and foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation  Under Mr  Clinton’s administration  donors were wooed with rounds of golf and nights in the Lincoln Bedroom ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Announces Campaign Finance Overhaul Plan","print_headline":"With Issue Galvanizing Voters,

m  | Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged on Tuesday that her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state was a “mistake ” and apologized directly for it  uttering words that many of her allies have waited to hear from her in hopes that she can quell a controversy that has dogged her presidential candidacy for months “That was a mistake  I’m sorry about that  I take responsibility ” Mrs  Clinton said in an interview with David Muir of ABC News broadcast Tuesday night  “And I’m trying to be as transparent as I possibly can ”Asked by Mr  Muir about a recent poll in which respondents used words like “liar” and “untrustworthy” to describe her  Mrs  Clinton conceded that she still had work to do  “Obviously  David  I don’t like hearing that ” she said  “I am confident by the end of this campaign  people will know they can trust me  and that I will be on their side and I will fight for them and their families  But I do think I could have and should have done a better job answering questions earlier  I really didn’t  perhaps  appreciate the need to do that ”When asked if she had ever second guessed her decision to make another run at the White House  Mrs  Clinton began to choke up  admitting that she had  at times  before invoking her mother’s admonitions to “fight for what you believe in  no matter how hard it is ”“I think about her a lot  I miss her a lot  I wish she were here with me ” Mrs  Clinton said of her mother  who died in 2011  But  she added  “I don’t want to just fight for me  I mean  I could have a perfectly fine life not being president  I want to fight for all the people like my mother who need somebody in their corner  And they need a leader who cares about them again  So that’s what I’m going to try to do ”Mrs  Clinton’s apology on ABC was the more striking for coming just a day after an interview with The Associated Press in which she maintained that she did not need to apologize for her private email account and server  saying  “What I did was allowed ”And in an interview with Andrea Mitchell of NBC News on Friday  Mrs  Clinton  asked if she was sorry  allowed only that she was “sorry that this has been confusing to people and has raised a lot of questions ”In an Aug  26 news conference  Mrs  Clinton said she understood why people had questions about the email arrangement  which she said came about as a matter of convenience so she could carry a single mobile device  She said she took responsibility for the decision to use the private server and said it would have been better to have used a private email only for personal matters and an official one for work Last week  Mrs  Clinton’s aides showed a video of that news conference to a New Hampshire focus group of independents and Democrats  according to a Democrat briefed on the focus group whose account was confirmed by a person in her campaign  Participants said they wanted to hear more from Mrs  Clinton about the issue The focus group also showed that the email issue was drowning out nearly everything else that Mrs  Clinton was hoping to communicate to voters — something Mrs  Clinton and her husband have complained about to friends Privately  some of Mrs  Clinton’s allies have drawn comparisons between her resistance to using the word “mistake” over the email server and her similar reluctance to say she had erred in voting as a senator to support the invasion of Iraq  That vote dogged her in the 2008 presidential primary  but Mrs  Clinton resisted calling it a mistake  despite entreaties from many liberals and some of her own aides Only in her 2014 memoir  “Hard Choices ” did Mrs  Clinton say she had “got it wrong” on the Iraq invasion “In our political culture  saying you made a mistake is often taken as weakness when in fact it can be a sign of strength and growth for people and nations ” Mrs  Clinton wrote “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had  And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong ” she wrote  “But I still got it wrong  Plain and simple ”In recent weeks  some advisers had privately expressed hope that Mrs  Clinton would acknowledge a mistake on her email practices in similarly clear and blunt terms But others on her team  saying they were bound by the constraints of a complex situation  with several investigations underway  argued that Mrs  Clinton was limited in her ability to defend herself For her part  Mrs  Clinton had long insisted that the controversy was a news media fixation that voters had not raised with her on the campaign trail  At a Democratic dinner in Iowa last month  she even made light of it  with a joke about the iPhone application Snapchat  whose pictures delete themselves  And a few days later  when a Fox News reporter asked if she had wiped her server of data  Mrs  Clinton quipped  “What  like with a cloth or something?”Mrs  Clinton  who has said that she broke no rules and is trying to be as transparent as possible  turned over about 55 000 pages of emails to the State Department  which is reviewing them to comply with freedom of information lawsuits  She has said she deleted the remaining 31 000  which she deemed not work related But the email controversy has stayed in the headlines  with new reports about whether Mrs  Clinton’s server contained classified information  the F B I ’s taking possession of the server to ensure its security  and the decision by the technician who maintained the server for Mrs  Clinton to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination   She says no material she sent or received was marked classified at the time  In recent days  Mrs  Clinton’s aides have signaled that she planned to address the email controversy more openly  and with a tone of humility rather than defensiveness ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton, Citing Her &#8216;Mistake,&#8217; Apologizes for Private Email","kicker":"First Draft","print_headline":"Clinton’s New

their arguments against the Iran nuclear deal  some Republican candidates have mocked President Obama for calling climate change the most serious threat facing the nation  It is worth noting then that the deal’s success might be assured while Mr  Obama is in the Arctic  warning of the effects of climate change Mr  Obama may be in the wilds of Alaska  but he is on the verge of a major foreign policy victory back home  The Senate is a vote short of making it impossible for opponents to block the nuclear deal with Iran Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware  both Democrats  said on Tuesday that they would vote against a resolution putting Congress on record against the Iran deal  becoming the 32nd and 33rd Democrats to do so  Thirty four votes are needed to sustain a presidential veto if the resolution of disapproval passes Now attention is turned to the 11 Democrats who have not officially disclosed their view  several of whom are widely expected to back the agreement Senator Benjamin L  Cardin of Maryland  the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee  has public appearances on Wednesday  but indications are that he will not announce his position on the Iran deal  Other Democratic senators being watched closely include Barbara A  Mikulski of Maryland  Joe Manchin III of West Virginia  who is believed to be leaning toward supporting the deal  Mark Warner of Virginia  Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  and Gary Peters of Michigan In the House  Democrats have maintained a steady parade in favor of the deal  and supporters of the president are optimistic they can keep Republicans from getting near the 290 votes required to override a presidential veto there  And if the House can sustain the veto  the Senate wouldn’t even have to vote a second time  With the votes to sustain a veto almost in hand  some Democrats are now pushing for the party to filibuster the deal on the Senate floor  avoiding a veto fight they say could weaken the president internationally even though the agreement would still go into force without majority congressional support — Carl HulseStay tuned throughout the day  Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates For candidates  and potential candidates  the late night talk shows seem to be an offshoot of the Sunday morning news shows  as Donald J  Trump is expected to soon follow Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey to “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon ” while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  Jeb Bush and Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  are all scheduled to appear on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” during his first several shows Mr  Biden will travel to Miami on Wednesday where he will speak at the Science Center at Miami Dade College  his office says  on the importance of “partnerships between community colleges and employers” in “helping Americans obtain the skills they need to succeed in the work force ”In the evening  he will speak at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event Mr  Biden may not have decided whether he will run for president  but his enthusiasts are not waiting to set up the makings of a South Carolina organization should he join the race The Draft Biden effort has settled on two well known South Carolina Democrats to lead the initiative in the state  Inez Tenenbaum  a former state superintendent of education  and State Senator Gerald Malloy The staff of the South Carolina draft effort  which could ultimately become Mr  Biden’s “super PAC ” will be led by Isaiah Nelson  who last year ran the coordinated campaign for the South Carolina Democratic Party Mr  Nelson worked under Dick Harpootlian  an outspoken Biden supporter and the state Democratic Party chairman at the time  and the former executive director Amanda Loveday  Should Mr  Biden enter the race  Ms  Loveday is also expected to play a role for him in South Carolina — Jonathan MartinLike Mr  Trump  Ben Carson  a retired neurosurgeon  has never held elected office  but polls suggest that voters are responding to his low key style CNN has changed its criteria to qualify for its debate in September  a move that effectively helps candidates who have moved up in the polls since the first debate — chiefly Carly Fiorina And Mr  Obama is in legacy building mode in Alaska  where he has been talking about the rapidly unfolding effects of climate change and the urgent need to address it  and has been crossing some items off his bucket list Mr  Trump  whose caustic statements on immigration have caused some controversy  took a step to try to smooth things over with Hispanics by inviting Javier Palomarez  president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  to his Manhattan office While voters seem to be increasingly gravitating to Mr  Sanders‘s message  his candidacy raises another question  Is the nation finally ready to embrace a politician from Brooklyn?And The Times’s About New York columnist Jim Dwyer writes of an encounter with Mr  Trump nearly 18 years ago that suggests his demeanor as a presidential candidate is far from new The A F L  C I O  has hinted it might delay its endorsement as a means in part to tilt the candidates toward more favorable positions  but Richard L  Trumka  the leader of the labor group who met privately with Mr  Biden last week  told reporters on Tuesday that he was open to an endorsement sometime before the first voting contests Yahoo Politics takes a look at Mr  Biden‘s potential 2016 run for president through the lens of his previous two  “in 1988  when he pulled out of the race amid a plagiarism controversy before voting began  and 2008  when he dropped out after coming in fifth in the Iowa caucuses  ”And New York magazine says that Mitt Romney is frustrated at Mr  Trump‘s success and how he is achieving it  which is “restarting ‘Mitt 2016’ talk ”And WMUR in New Hampshire reports that Mr  Christie is releasing a new ad about the growing heroin epidemic in the state While many other aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton are deferential in their emails to her  one former aide  Cheryl Mills  her former chief of staff  is “the only person who says no to Hillary ” Politico reports  “She can be brusque  sometimes responding to Clinton’s questions with a simple ‘y’ as if she is too busy to finish typing the three letter word

If not  why not?”Walker responded with an answer about sufficient training of officers “not only on the way into their positions but all the way through their time” and about “consequences” for those who don’t properly perform their duties Both the question and the answer focused an inordinate amount of attention on police conduct and not enough on revealing that they are simply the agents of policy instituted by officials at the behest of the body politic This deficit of examining systems exists all across this debate  It fails to indict society as a whole  as I firmly believe it should  It puts all the focus on the tip of the spear rather than on the spear itself Look at it this way  Many local municipalities experience budgetary pressure  Rather than raise taxes or cut services in response  things that are often politically unpalatable  they turn to law enforcement and courts to make up the difference in tickets and fines  Some can also increase the number of finable offenses and stiffen the penalties Officers  already disproportionately deployed and arrayed in so called “high crime” neighborhoods — invariably poor and minority neighborhoods — are then charged with doing the dirty work  The increase in sheer numbers of interactions creates friction with targeted populations and ups the odds that individual biases will be introduced Without fail  something eventually goes horribly wrong We look at the end interaction  examining the officers for bias and the suspect for threatening behavior  rather than looking at the systems that necessitated the interactions Society itself is to blame  There is blood on everyone’s hands  including the hands still clutching the tax revenue that those cities needed but refused to solicit  instead shifting the mission of entire police departments “from ‘protect and serve’ to ‘punish and profit ’ ” as Mother Jones magazine recently put it in a fascinating article on this subject Is it a coincidence that many of the recent cases involving black people killed by the police began with stops for minor offenses?This “fiscal menace ” as the magazine called it  is added to a system often already addicted to ever improving crime numbers — a statistically unsustainable condition — and a ballooning prison population  To maintain the momentum  cities needed to crack down on lower and lower level crimes  sacrificing more and more lives — largely poor and minority ones — to feed the beast  Public safety gave cover for a perversion of justice In another moment during the debate  Kelly asked Ben Carson about race relations in America and “how divided we seem right now ” She continued  “And what  if anything  you can do — you would do as the next president to help heal that divide ”First  before the answer  I have a nit to pick with the question  The framing of the state of race relations as a “divide ” to my mind  creates a false impression  an equivalency  It suggests a lateral ness  But this discussion is about vertical ness  about hierarchy  It is about whether state power is being used disproportionately as an oppressive and deadly force against minorities — particularly black people — in this country Carson responded with a prelude that seemed to label those demanding justice and equality “purveyors of hatred” seeking a “race war ” an outrageously exaggerated use of incendiary rhetoric Then he said “What we need to think about instead — you know  I was asked by an NPR reporter once  why don’t I talk about race that often  I said it’s because I’m a neurosurgeon  And she thought that was a strange response  And you say — I said  you see  when I take someone to the operating room  I’m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are  The skin doesn’t make them who they are  The hair doesn’t make them who they are  And it’s time for us to move beyond that ”This was an eloquent exposition of the absurdity of race as a biological construct  but also an absurdly elementary avoidance of racism as a very real social construct  I wish it were that people could all simply “move beyond that” at will  that they were able to simply choose to slough off the cumulative accrual of centuries of systematic anti black negativity  But  that is not a power people possess That is why when people respond to “Black Lives Matter” with “All Lives Matter ” it grates  All Lives Matter may be one’s personal position  but until this country values all lives equally  it is both reasonable and indeed necessary to specify the lives it seems to value less ","headline":{"main":"‘Black Lives Matter’ and the G.O.P.","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"‘Black Lives  Matter’ and the G.O.P."},"wordCount":"834"},

never held elective office  said on Sunday that he would seek the 2016 Republican nomination for president  joining the party’s fast growing field Mr  Carson  who appeared on the political scene just two years ago and gained attention among conservatives for a speech highly critical of President Obama  planned a formal announcement of his candidacy on Monday in his native Detroit  He began his rise from poverty there to the heights of medicine — a path that shaped his rejection of liberal social policies in favor of self reliance On Sunday evening  Mr  Carson said in an interview with a Washington television station that he was entering the race  “I’m announcing my candidacy for president of the United States ” he told WJLA Despite a crowded Republican field likely to be among the strongest and broadest in decades  Mr  Carson  63  believes there is a clamor for an insurgent candidate without ties to party politics But that belief is likely to be tested quickly as he is forced to compete for donors and support with more established and organized candidates like Senators Ted Cruz of Texas  Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida — all of whom have announced their candidacies — and leading party figures like Jeb Bush  the former Florida governor  and Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin Mr  Carson may also struggle to claim the outsider mantle  Carly Fiorina  the former Hewlett Packard chief executive  also planned to formally enter the Republican race on Monday  making an online announcement in contrast to the staged kickoffs of Mr  Carson and the other declared candidates Nor will he have the spotlight for long  On Tuesday  former Gov  Mike Huckabee of Arkansas plans to announce his second presidential campaign in his native Hope  Ark One challenge for Mr  Carson is whether he can appeal beyond the grass roots conservatives who initially flocked to him  delighted by his eye gouging of the president  It is a rhetorical style he has pledged to eliminate as he seeks broader support But Mr  Carson may attract early attention because of the national focus on the death of a black man who was injured in police custody in Baltimore  where Mr  Carson lived and worked for 35 years He draws an aggressive contrast with Democrats over antipoverty issues  and in speeches has told of how his mother  a cleaning woman  struggled to stay off welfare because everyone she knew who took government aid never escaped it In an interview before his announcement  he said that “personal responsibility  hard work and compassion for our fellow human beings” were the keys of climbing out of poverty  Mr  Obama  by contrast  he said  “seems to believe more in a utopian view of cradle to grave care ”Mr  Carson’s biography will feature prominently in his campaign  His mother  Sonya Carson  had only a third grade education  but he went on to graduate from Yale and the University of Michigan Medical School  and at age 33 was named chief of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore  becoming the youngest person  and the first black doctor  to hold the title He burst onto the political scene in 2013 with a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast that denounced the country’s “moral decay” and Mr  Obama’s health care law  The Wall Street Journal followed with an editorial  “Ben Carson for President ”An independent political action committee seeking to draft him to run demonstrated his small donor appeal by raising  13 million  It announced it had recruited leaders in all 99 counties in Iowa  which holds the first nominating contest Mr  Carson’s campaign announced monday morning that he would leave from his announcement for Dallas  where his mother  who was in failing health  has become critically ill  Originally scheduled to to travel to Iowa for three days of speeches and campaig stops  he plans to campaign there Tuesday and Wednesday  said Armstrong Williams  a senior adviser Mr  Carson must devise a coherent policy message and convince voters that he is fit for political leadership with no governing experience  He spent five hours at the conservative Heritage Foundation recently taking tutorials on domestic and foreign policy He has also undergone media training to round the edges off his incendiary language  In 2013  Mr  Carson was forced to withdraw as a commencement speaker at Johns Hopkins after linking same sex marriage to pedophilia  He has pronounced the president’s health care law the worst thing to happen in American “since slavery ” And in March  he issued an apology after declaring that the experience of men in prison proved that homosexuality was a choice “I’ve come to recognize that when you use certain terms  people can no longer hear anything else you say ” Mr  Carson said in the interview before his announcement  “As you’ll notice in the last several weeks  I’ve been able to get my points across without inflammatory language ”","headline":{"main":"Ben

DAVENPORT  Iowa – On a day Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush scheduled campaign events a few miles apart  Mrs  Clinton jabbed at two Bushes — the one running for president and the brother who once had the job Mrs  Clinton disparaged Mr  Bush’s “stuff happens” comment about gun violence  and she repeatedly invoked what she considers the policy failures of George W  Bush’s presidency  including deep tax cuts for the wealthy and an effort to privatize Social Security Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Bush circled each other in Iowa on Tuesday as the struggling standard bearers of their parties’ establishments  Both were once seen as likely general election opponents  Now they each face serious challenges from populist outsiders At a town hall style event in Davenport  Mrs  Clinton staked out several positions — reining in Wall Street and supporting gun control and ambitious public works projects  for example — that seemed influenced by the Democratic Party’s leftward shift in recent years Later in the day  she said she had sent every Republican candidate a copy of her book “Hard Choices” after Carly Fiorina and others questioned what she had accomplished as secretary of state  “There are so many of them ” she said  referring to the 15 candidates in the Republican field  “they could have a book club ”The Bush campaign quickly hit back over Mrs  Clinton’s use of a private email server in the State Department  and suggested that she read Mr  Bush’s book “Reply All” when it is published in a few weeks  “The book  based on Governor Bush’s emails while in office  is a good lesson on the importance of transparency in government ” said a campaign spokeswoman  Kristy Campbell  who added that Mr  Bush had not received Mrs  Clinton’s book Mr  Bush  setting off on his longest Iowa swing as a candidate  is hoping to deepen his support in a state where he has few natural advantages — and the poll numbers to prove it  Before his scheduled remarks Tuesday evening at the Scott County Republicans annual Ronald Reagan Dinner in Bettendorf  Mr  Bush’s campaign announced a handful of new endorsements in the state  including one from Mayor Steve Gaer of West Des Moines  a former Scott Walker supporter whose blessing had been sought by other candidates appealing to Main Street Republicans At the event  Mr  Bush  repeating an argument he made in an op ed article in The Des Moines Register on Tuesday  took up the difficult task of casting himself as an outsider  disparaging Washington as a city where “home prices never dropped during the financial crisis ”“Washington is doing fine ” he told the crowd  “What we need to do is disrupt Washington ”He also repeated his plan to dock the pay of federal lawmakers who miss votes  in what has been viewed as a swipe at Senator Marco Rubio of Florida  who has missed them frequently “They should go to the committee hearings  they should vote ” Mr  Bush said Mrs  Clinton promised to unveil proposals next week to “go after Wall Street abuses” and hold banks and individuals responsible for “their bad behavior ” an issue that regularly stirs loud applause at the rallies of Senator Bernie Sanders  the Vermont independent who is challenging her for the Democratic presidential nomination Despite benefiting from the support of wealthy Democratic donors on Wall Street  Mrs  Clinton approvingly noted that Ben S  Bernanke  the former Federal Reserve chairman  said while promoting his new memoir that “people should have gone to jail” after the financial crisis of 2008 On gun control  where Mr  Sanders has been skeptical of the push for new restrictions  Mrs  Clinton seemed to have both him and Mr  Bush in mind when she disparaged Mr  Bush’s comment  after the shooting massacre last week at an Oregon community college  that “stuff happens ”“This doesn’t just happen ” Mrs  Clinton said  “This isn’t stuff that happens  We let it happen  and we have to act ”In a lighter moment  Mrs  Clinton was asked by an attendee to do her impression of Mr  Trump that she debuted on “Saturday Night Live” over the weekend  Mrs  Clinton obliged  “Oh  you’re a loser ” she said in a deep voice  to laughter But the challenge of Mr  Trump and the other outsiders of both parties — for Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Bush as well — was illustrated by an attendee at the Clinton event  Jerry Propps  a retired truck driver  Although Mr  Propps said he was making up his mind between Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders  he acknowledged he was also drawn to issues that Mr  Trump had highlighted  the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and immigration “When it comes to allowing illegal immigrants in this country  I’m sorry to say  I’m with Trump on that ” he said Coincidentally  Mrs  Clinton’s itinerary on Tuesday  from Davenport to Muscatine  retraced the route of Mr  Sanders during a visit to Iowa in May  when a crowd of 700 was an early warning to the Clinton campaign of his nascent support here  Mrs  Clinton  eclipsed by Mr  Sanders in New Hampshire polls  is still hanging on to a slender margin in Iowa “I think a lot of people are looking at Bernie Sanders  but I don’t think hardly anyone is going to vote for him ” said a Clinton supporter  Bob Sanderson  a retired Army veteran  in Davenport  “They like what he’s saying right now  nobody thinks he can win in a general election ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Takes On

increasingly worried about the threat of a challenge from Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   is making a sudden and urgent effort to throw roadblocks into his path After months of voicing doubt about a challenge from the vice president  Clinton campaign operatives are viewing Mr  Biden’s entry into the contest as a serious possibility and are trying to rally the party’s apparatus and its donors to her side  They have flooded uncommitted Democrats with emails  phone calls and a plea for them to sign a letter  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  In the letter  Democrats are asked to “pledge to support Hillary Rodham Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Committee Convention with my unpledged delegate vote ”A campaign aide said that given the mistakes of Mrs  Clinton’s 2008 campaign  they had always planned to make an early and aggressive push to lock down superdelegate support This Saturday  hours before Mr  Biden appears as the keynote speaker at the annual gala of the Human Rights Campaign  the most influential gay and lesbian political group in the country  Mrs  Clinton will have breakfast with the same group  And next Tuesday  former President Bill Clinton will appear on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert ” after an emotionally powerful appearance by Mr  Biden that became a viral video among some in the Democratic Party Mr  Biden has kept even his loyal supporters guessing about whether he will become a candidate  But the Clinton campaign is not taking chances  A subtle critique is emerging from the campaign’s allies about the potential vulnerabilities Mr  Biden would bring to the race This week  David Brock  who created the pro Clinton group Correct the Record  which is coordinating with Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  told Chicago Magazine his “gut” told him Mr  Biden would not run because “he’ll realize that at this point in his career  he can go out with everyone’s respect and esteem ”On a recent stop at a diner in Laconia  N H   Mrs  Clinton answered a voter’s question about why she had supported bankruptcy legislation that Senator Elizabeth Warren  Democrat of Massachusetts  and other liberal activists opposed  Unprompted  she raised the vice president’s role in the bill “I said  ‘It’s really important to me that we don’t hurt women and children  so I will support it even though there are other things I don’t like in it ’ ” Mrs  Clinton told the questioner  Jo Smith  Then she added  “It was Vice President Biden who was the senator from Delaware and the Republican co sponsor that I was talking with ”Aides to Mr  Biden did not comment  And Clinton aides  speaking on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing strategy in public  said that the effort to mobilize Democrats behind her was a natural progression of her candidacy  and unrelated to any potential challenger But several Democrats who have been in close contact with the campaign say they see a new sense of seriousness among her advisers about the prospect of a Biden candidacy  Mrs  Clinton’s team has been adamant that they are not behind efforts to draw negative attention to Mr  Biden  or to do anything to pressure him  Among the clearest signs in the last week was a series of phone calls from Mrs  Clinton and two of her top advisers  Huma Abedin and John Podesta  to the financier Robert Wolf  a major Democratic donor who is now supporting Mrs  Clinton but who recently met privately with Mr  Biden  In an email  Mr  Wolf confirmed recent discussions with Mrs  Clinton and her aides Mrs  Clinton raised roughly  28 million during the last three months  her campaign said on Wednesday — a sharp drop from the  47 5 million raised in the previous three months  partly because of the sluggish summer fund raising months and the possibility that Mr  Biden will enter the race Mr  Biden’s allies have made clear they are watching Mrs  Clinton’s poll numbers and the fallout over her use of a private email account at the State Department  And it has become increasingly clear that the activity by Mr  Biden’s associates to prepare for a potential campaign and to assess the amount of money and staff available to him has gained the attention of Mrs  Clinton’s operation The specter of Mr  Biden looms as a potential danger  but also as an incentive to motivate Mrs  Clinton and her operation   and to recover the fighting form she developed late in the 2008 presidential primary “I think they’re trying to create the impression that it will be difficult for anybody to climb up and beat Hillary in the superdelegate count ” said Ed Rendell  a former governor of Pennsylvania who is supporting Mrs  Clinton  But  he added  “I wouldn’t pressure people too hard if I were them ”Much of the Clinton campaign’s focus has been on the so called superdelegates  the elected officials and party elders who have significant influence in the nomination process  and whose endorsement carries weight with party insiders  Some superdelegates who have withheld their endorsement of Mrs  Clinton  in part because they are waiting to see if Mr  Biden will enter the race  have experienced heightened pressure from the Clinton campaign Should he decide to run  Mr  Biden and Mrs  Clinton would compete aggressively for the backing of African Americans  who have a hugely favorable opinion of Mrs  Clinton but who remain fiercely loyal to President Obama  and could see Mr  Biden’s candidacy as a continuation and affirmation of the first black president’s legacy Mrs  Clinton has made it a priority to reach out to African Americans throughout her campaign  with sweeping speeches on criminal justice reform and voting rights  James H  Hodges  a former governor of South Carolina who has endorsed Mrs  Clinton  said he liked and respected Mr  Biden — a line Clinton supporters often recite by heart — but concluded  “There is only one person who could beat Hillary Clinton in our state  and that’s Barack Obama  and last time I checked  he’s not eligible to run again ”","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Camp Is Making Moves to Check Joe Biden","print_headline":"Clinton Camp Making

In a forceful speech on Saturday to an influential gay rights group  Hillary Rodham Clinton reaffirmed her support for gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender Americans Hours later  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who is contemplating his own presidential run  stood before the same organization and praised Americans who have fought for gay rights “Love is not a political matter  it’s a basic human right ” Mr  Biden said to a gathering of members of the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday night  “The fact that we recognize that  it’s because of you ”Mr  Biden’s potential candidacy has loomed over Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  and the speeches on Saturday presented a rare occasion for these two former Senate colleagues and potential rivals to showcase their zeal and style on gay rights  one of the most galvanizing issues for Democratic primary voters and donors In her address  Mrs  Clinton focused on policies she would enact with a promise to make lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender issues central to her presidency  Mr  Biden said government had not been the driver of the rapid change in gay rights  and gave credit to the people in the crowd and the Americans across the country who came out about their sexuality  Both speeches drew roaring applause and enthusiasm from the crowd Mrs  Clinton  who addressed the organization on Saturday morning  emphasized transgender rights  which are seen as the next front in the gay rights movement in America  “Transgender people are valued  they are loved  they are us ” Mrs  Clinton said She vowed to do more to curb violence against transgender people  particularly African American women  and urged the military to reverse its policy and allow transgender Americans to serve in the armed forces  “Having the world’s strongest military  she said  “doesn’t just mean having the best trained forces or the biggest arsenal ”“It means ” she added  “being a leader on issues like this ”Mr  Biden called transgender rights “the civil rights issue of our time” and also expressed his support for allowing their service in the military   In an aside  he also called for increased gun control measures in light of the mass shooting in Oregon  The speeches allowed Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Biden to address an important constituency and powerful donor base of prominent  politically active lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people from across the country who will be critical in the 2016 presidential contest — a group that largely views both Democrats exceedingly favorably “I see the injustices and dangers that you and your family still face ” Mrs  Clinton said  “I am running for president to end them once and for all ”Mr  Biden did not offer any hints about his presidential ambitions  even amid the occasional chant of “run Joe  run ”   He echoed much of what Mrs  Clinton said in her speech  calling on Congress to pass the Federal Equality Act and urging more attention to human rights abuses against gay  lesbian and transgender people abroad The Human Rights Campaign  led by a former aide to President Bill Clinton from Arkansas  Chad Griffin  has deep ties to Mrs  Clinton and had invited her to deliver the keynote address at its gathering Saturday night  But Mrs  Clinton had a scheduling conflict — she was to appear on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” — so the group added a breakfast at which she could speak  The organization also honored Tim Cook  the chief executive of Apple  who recently came out as gay The group has started its endorsement process  with questionnaires sent to candidates  but it does not typically back a candidate until the general election In her address  Mrs  Clinton delivered a pointed attack on Republican presidential candidates who oppose same sex marriage and other equal protections  “You turn on the TV and you see a Republican candidate for president literally standing in the courthouse door in Kentucky ” she said  referring to Mike Huckabee’s support of Kim Davis  the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples Both Mr  Biden’s and Mrs  Clinton’s attacks on Republicans were delivered with some levity that played well in the crowds at their two appearances on Saturday  “Ted Cruz slammed a political opponent for marching in a pride parade ” Mrs  Clinton said  “He clearly has no idea what he’s missing ”Mr  Biden  in talking about how the vast majority of Americans support same sex marriage  appeared to deliver an off the cuff line  “There are homophobes still left  most of them are running for president  I think ” he said Some gay activists say Mrs  Clinton offered a relatively delayed and cautious embrace of same sex marriage  Mr  Biden’s surprising expression of support for same sex marriage in 2012 was widely seen as prodding President Obama to take the same position days later  which was not lost on the crowd on Saturday Of his 2012 comment on “Meet the Press” about same sex marriage  Mr  Biden said  “Folks  I was just answering in a straightforward  direct way  what I’ve known my whole life ” and told a story of learning tolerance as a teenager growing up in Delaware “I absolutely love Joe Biden ” said Brad DiFiore  a 46 year old who works in the aviation industry in Atlanta and was in town for the gathering He said that he had never been a supporter of Mrs  Clinton but that she impressed him with her remarks that morning  “She was more impressive in person and had such a natural ease in that environment ” he said Mrs  Clinton has in recent years rejected two policies from her husband’s administration that were seen as setting back the gay rights movement — a position she reiterated on Saturday “ ‘Don’t ask  don’t tell’ is over ” Mrs  Clinton said about the legislation enacted by her husband that prevented gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military  “But that doesn’t change the fact that more than 14 000 men and women were forced out of the military for being gay ”Both Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Biden expressed support for the Obama administration’s policy that reverses dishonorable discharges given to people because of their sexual orientation “I think she’s been very good on L G B T  issues  but always in the context of politics ” said Seth Kalish  48  a graphic designer  “It’s typical for someone wanting to get to the White House to be cautious ”Others blamed Mrs  Clinton’s husband for her mixed experiences on same sex issues  “That was Bill  and it was a different time ” said Ellen Griffith  54  a consultant who married her wife  Mary Ellen Garrity  last year “That was some unfortunate legislation ” Ms  Griffith said of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act and “don’t ask  don’t tell ” “But the important thing is that she admits it

Fire Fighters  one of the country’s more politically powerful unions  has abandoned its initial plans to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton for president  according to union sources Harold A  Schaitberger  the union’s general president  informed Mrs  Clinton’s campaign manager  Robby Mook  in a telephone call on Monday  According to a union official  Mr  Schaitberger told Mr  Mook that the executive board and rank and file members — the latter were recently polled — did not support a Clinton endorsement The early support of a cross section of unions — most prominently the American Federation of Teachers  which endorsed Mrs  Clinton in July — had been a source of strength for the Clinton campaign  But in recent weeks  as Mrs  Clinton’s numbers in some polls have sagged and she has faced an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  some labor unions appear to have had second thoughts The impetus for Mr  Schaitberger’s call to Mr  Mook were conversations about the endorsement at the board’s meetings in mid September  when board members expressed interest in the possibility that Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  would join the Democratic field “Secretary Clinton doesn’t sell well here ” said Roy L  McGhee III  better known as Sandy McGhee  an I A F F  board member who represents Texas and Oklahoma  “I think the Republican attack machine  the media machine  has made sure of that  The vice president will do better  He’s popular among firefighters ”A spokesman for the Clinton campaign said that as with the campaign’s discussions with other unions  an I A F F  endorsement was never guaranteed Mr  Schaitberger worried that a Clinton endorsement could deeply divide the firefighters  according to a union official who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the endorsement decision  Members tilt Republican  but the union typically endorses Democrats for president because of their stances on labor and other issues of importance to firefighters  Union officials have cited Mr  Biden’s decades long record of leadership on these issues In a sign of how important labor support is  the Clinton campaign regularly promotes endorsements from unions like the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America and the United Union of Roofers  Waterproofers and Allied Workers  Seven national unions  representing four million working families  have endorsed Mrs  Clinton  her campaign said “When unions are strong  families are strong — and when families are strong  America is strong ” she often says But two major unions  the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  have said they will hold off on an endorsement until they have completed the process of consulting with their members  Union leaders have said the decision has as much to do with Mr  Sanders as with Mr  Biden’s looming decision about whether to enter the race Against this backdrop  the possibility of losing formal support from the firefighters comes as a particularly unwelcome blow The Clinton campaign had been in touch with the union about the possibility of an endorsement during the first several months of 2015  But the talks became serious in June  when Mr  Schaitberger  with the assent of his board  told the campaign the union was strongly leaning toward endorsing Mrs  Clinton  pending the board’s formal vote The two sides later began working out details of the endorsement that Mr  Schaitberger and his board had viewed as nearly inevitable  including discussions about the timing and location of an announcement  The most recent plans would have had Mr  Schaitberger endorse Mrs  Clinton this month in Iowa In late July  senior union officials traveled to Mrs  Clinton’s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to meet with several of her political and policy aides  The meetings took place under the assumption that the endorsement was on track  according to the union official  Their purpose was to educate the campaign about the policies that union members would want to see Mrs  Clinton discuss  and the rhetoric they would want her to use when discussing them In the evening  the I A F F  officials dined with senior Clinton campaign aides at a Brooklyn restaurant But the clear discomfort of the union’s membership with Mrs  Clinton  as well as Mr  Biden’s possible candidacy  made the endorsement increasingly untenable As Mr  Biden contemplates a run  organized labor represents one of the main Democratic constituencies he and Mrs  Clinton would fight over most intensely  Mr  Biden has been courting union officials  including the A F L  C I O  president  Richard L  Trumka  and the service employees union leader  Mary Kay Henry  Mr  Biden recounted his conversations with labor leaders to one Democratic official last month  saying they had told him they were not sure Mrs  Clinton could win  according to the official The firefighters’ union  though it claims only about 300 000 members — far fewer than the teachers’  service employees’ and municipal employees’ unions  each with more than a million members — has a history of exerting outsize political influence  thanks in part to the esteem in which the public holds firefighters The union  which endorsed the presidential campaign of Secretary of State John Kerry in September 2003  is credited by many with having helped resurrect his campaign in Iowa  where his victory in the state’s 2004 caucuses propelled him to the Democratic nomination  In 2011  the union was critical to a no vote in a referendum that overturned legislation restricting collective bargaining rights for public employees in Ohio  Other political moves have proved less effective  The union’s pick in the 2008 Democratic presidential contest  Senator Christopher J  Dodd  of Connecticut  withdrew after barely registering in the Iowa caucuses  An I A F F  spokesman said the union had hoped to keep its endorsement process private and had no intention of embarrassing Mrs  Clinton or her campaign  If Mrs  Clinton were to win the Democratic nomination  the union would most likely endorse her for the general election  according to the official ","headline":{"main":"Firefighters’ Union Backs Away From Endorsement of Hillary

minutes of fame ” the Vermont senator said gruffly over the phone  Gruff is pretty much his normal way of speaking  but Sanders was actually in a good mood at this point in the conversation  Later  the volume would escalate He announced he was running for the Democratic nomination on Thursday  first in an email  then in a makeshift press conference on the lawn outside the Capitol  There are worse approaches  One of the few previous presidential candidates from Vermont was George Dewey  the hero of the Spanish American War  Dewey started his campaign off with a statement that read  in part  “Since studying the subject I am convinced that the office of the president is not such a very difficult one to fill      ” It was pretty much downhill from there Sanders’s beginning was more auspicious  His infant campaign raised more than  1 5 million in donations in the first 24 hours  “Thirty five thousand donations averaging  43 apiece ”For you  concerned citizen  this is nothing but good news  For one thing  we can now spend the winter entertaining the idea of a President Bernie  Plus  competition is always better  Hillary Clinton is no longer in danger of spending the next year just listening to average voters and denying she feels entitled Besides the two announced candidates  there will probably be other contenders  including former Maryland governor Martin  “former Maryland governor”  O’Malley  Also interested are ex Senator Jim Webb of Virginia and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island  a former Republican senator turned former independent governor who is now a Democrat Question  What about Elizabeth Warren?Answer  As a rule  when somebody says they are not running for president more than 100 times  it is a strong indication that they are not running for president Question  Sanders self identifies as a “democratic socialist ” Aren’t people going to think that’s a little extreme?Answer  This week  the governor of Texas announced he was putting a special watch on U S  military exercises this summer  due to public speculation that the soldiers might take over the state and confiscate everyone’s guns  Also  the Idaho Legislature recently killed a bill that would have provided federal aid in tracking down deadbeat dads  due to concern that it might involve the use of Shariah law  I do not want to hear you calling Bernie Sanders an extremist Sanders said his campaign goal is to “lay down a progressive agenda which speaks to the needs of working people ” This would include making “the wealthiest people and corporations start paying their fair share of taxes ”Now this is a problem for Democrats who envision the senator as a tool to push Hillary Clinton to the left  We already know she’s going to talk endlessly about bridging the economic divide  It might help if there were more specific specifics “You don’t know much about me  right?” asked Sanders  launching into another list of his causes  tax reform  health care  fixing the crumbling infrastructure “I voted against DOMA — you know what DOMA is?” he demanded  referring to the anti gay Defense of Marriage Act  which Clinton once supported during her husband’s presidency  “I’m not evolving when it comes to gay rights  I was there ”The sun was sinking over this conversation   “You got me riled up here ”  The problem was that I was talking about his potential as a debating partner who could turn Clinton into a more progressive candidate  while Bernie Sanders wants to be regarded as a potential president of the United States “I do resent that ” he agreed  “I am in this race to win ”Sanders doesn’t really want Democratic voters to compare him with Clinton to see who has the best positions on the issues  He wants them to decide who has the most consistent record in fighting for those issues  and there is absolutely no question in the world that when it comes to consistency  Bernie Sanders is Mount Rushmore to Hillary Clinton’s Sheila the Shapeshifter Her political life has been a continual  sometimes unedifying  struggle to get the power to do what she believed were the right things for the country  His began with a long list of principled and totally hopeless campaigns whose dismal outcomes he recounts proudly in speeches  “    I received 2 percent of the vote  Not dissuaded  I ran a year later for governor of the State of Vermont  and received 1 percent of the vote      ”Then came an improbable win for mayor of the small city of Burlington  which he governed well  Then it was off to the House and the Senate  where he fought for progressive causes  He has now been in Congress for 24 years — longer  he likes to point out  than any other independent in American history You’ve got to give him credit  Welcome to the

president on Thursday  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont chose a grassy spot outside the Capitol to hold a 10 minute news conference about his priorities for the country and his challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination  Over instant messages at noon  two New York Times correspondents  Patrick Healy and Maggie Haberman  analyzed Mr  Sanders’s remarks  Here  lightly edited  is their full chat Pat  Hi  Maggie  So two weeks ago  we had Hillary Rodham Clinton announcing her presidential candidacy in her snappy “everyday American” video  and now we have Senator Bernie Sanders announcing his candidacy in a swamp   The U S  Senate swamp  that is  And Bernie seems to be in a rush  Who starts off his campaign kickoff speech saying  “We don’t have an endless amount of time — we have to get back” to the Senate?Maggie  Hi  Patrick  Back again So this is a very different type of setting than anything we’ve seen with Hillary Rodham Clinton This is an open air press conference  Greenery in the background Maggie  “I voted against the war in Iraq ”There it is Pat  Wow — Iraq is back Talk about reaching back in time for a club to whack Hillary with Sent at 12 14 PM on ThursdayMaggie  Well — that was brief This seemed like a lunchtime break in which declaring for president was an afterthought  It wasn’t even 15 minutes Pat  Very fast — and very loose  If Hillary Clinton is running a tightly scripted  highly disciplined campaign for the Democratic nomination  Bernie Sanders is running without a filter  His first reference point in his remarks was “the Great Depression of the 1930s” — he just sort of spit out the comparison  which is more resonant for the 73 year old Sanders and his generation than for many Americans But then things got sharper  as he zeroed in on income inequality  Is that what a Sanders Clinton race will be about?Maggie  Yes I noticed that too  Total clarity of message — not doing what the press wanted  which was sticking around endlessly and answering every question  So this is actually painting a different frame — he’s contrasting by showing he is going to do an actual press conference  but he is also letting his message stand I do wonder how Hillary is going to deal with the Iraq war on the debate stage  And that may be one of many reasons her folks have been mulling whether to agree to one Sent at 12 21 PM on ThursdayPat  We’ll have to wait and see if Bernie continues to hit Hillary on Iraq  I couldn’t quite tell if he was drawing a contrast with Hillary or sending her team a message on Iraq — that he would actually be willing to hit her hard  Again  no filter Bernie will be unpredictable Maggie  I wasn’t sure either  It almost seemed like a throwaway But to your other point  there was a very clear life contrast made there Pat  Very — he’s older  Score one for Hillary Kidding — your point is a good one  Several contrasts there The bulk of his remarks were on income inequality  He decried “longer hours for lower wages” and the rise in childhood poverty  and then hit this point  “The major issue is  how do we create an economy that works for all of our people  as opposed to a small number of billionaires?”Bernie returned to this by noting that billionaires don’t give to him — implicitly pointing out all those Wall Street friends of the Clintons And their foundation Maggie  Totally And also  I would argue that he had an important line  He described himself as a leader in the fight against the Iraq war I think that’s something people are going to use against her over and over Sent at 12 27 PM on ThursdayPat  He also positioned himself as a leader on campaign finance reform  “We now have a political situation where billionaires are literally able to buy elections and candidates — let’s not kid ourselves ” he said  That point will resonate with Democratic  liberal  primary voters — but how strongly?Maggie  Yes  that was notable  He is going to make campaign finance his strong calling card He also has a strong progressive following Pat  “I’m not going to get money from the Koch brothers  I’m not going to get my money from billionaires” — you said it  Bernie Maggie  And one thing that I think people are missing about him — his neighbor state positioning with New Hampshire is going to give him a bit of a leg up Pat  Absolutely  It helped Mitt Romney and John Kerry  both from neighboring Massachusetts  But it didn’t help the last Vermont Democrat who ran for the presidency    remember him?Maggie  Ha Speaking of that person [Howard Dean]  he did endorse Clinton this time around    but I digress I think Sanders has been smart about tending to his New Hampshire politics I also think there’s a fundamental question right now for the Democratic Party  and it’s one that Clinton folks are going to have to grapple with  At a deeply polarized moment when independent voters are shrinking  which voters should these candidates be appealing to?In other words  does it actually hurt Democrats to tack left?Bernie Sanders is opposed to the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal — that deal has bipartisan opposition Pat  It’s easy to see Senator Sanders appealing to the left in natural ways  as Howard Dean and Barack Obama did in opposing the Iraq war And today  there is a great deal of progressive energy among Democratic primary voters who are looking for a leader  Many of them are glad Obama is president  but you can tell they are looking for a powerful and unfiltered voice on progressive issues Maggie  Absolutely I think the word “lead” was among the more significant of his Pat  I agree  He also used the M word toward the end — “movement ”Progressives see so many causes to unite and march around  That energy is real Maggie  I think that’s exactly right There’s been a big question since 2013  when Bill Daley opted not to run for governor and Bill de Blasio won for mayor in N Y C   about whether there was a true progressive movement Or if these were isolated incidents And I think Bernie Sanders can really test that theory Sent at 12 39 PM on ThursdayPat  He will certainly get a considerable amount of media attention for that theory  right? Because reporters are eager to cover a Democratic political contest issue debate over the next year Maggie  I think that’s right  And I think there’s a certain benefit toward being the first non Clinton opponent to get in Especially for Sanders  who had been waffling in public remarks about whether he would do it Pat  Do you believe him when he said  at the end  “We’re in this race to win?”Maggie  I do  actually I have yet to hear his folks articulate a clear path  but I think he has something to say and wants to go as far as he can Do you?Pat  I do believe him  I think he sees a need for a historically consistent progressive voice in the 2016 race  He nodded to his own long history as a liberal and political outlier  I imagine he will run hard  Part of me wonders if Gov  Jerry Brown of California will look at Sanders and say  “If him  then why not me?”Sent at 12 44 PM on ThursdayMaggie  YES I had the exact same thought  Who else is out there who is itching to get in?Pat  Sherrod Brown of Ohio? Deval Patrick of Massachusetts? Time will tell ","headline":{"main":"Times Reporters Analyze Bernie Sanders’s Presidential Campaign Remarks"},"wordCount":"1289"},

Friday morning  The Iran nuclear deal has been making its way back to the Capitol during summer break  even if Congress has not  and it will be a focus of several events  But the big party is with the

speeches by four of the party’s presidential candidates — Lincoln Chafee  the former Rhode Island governor  and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the morning  Martin O’Malley  the former Maryland governor  and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the afternoon – to hundreds of activists who are plenty familiar with their political speeches and policy views  So will the contenders say anything new or surprising?Mr  Sanders  for one  was playing around with ideas on a yellow legal pad as he flew to Minneapolis on Thursday  according to Democrats on the plane with him  Like the other candidates  he has only about 10 minutes to speak  but advisers expect him to make a sincere pitch — even if he is not a Democrat  but an independent — as an outsider who is attracting big crowds “He will say if Democrats want to keep the White House ” said Michael Briggs  Mr  Sanders’s campaign spokesman  “then establishment politics won’t do it ”“Few would deny he is generating excitement  and that’s what the party needs ”Mr  O’Malley has been arguing that the current plan for only six debates favors Mrs  Clinton  who is leading in the polls  Several Democrats said they were curious if Mr  O’Malley

The rollout of the endorsement  and memos released by the Clinton team on Thursday detailing her organizational power in early voting states  are gestures that many see as timed to the party meeting and to Mr  Biden’s 2016 deliberations But  to Mr  Vilsack  it was personal “This introduction means a lot to me ” he told a crowd in Sioux City He recalled how Mrs  Clinton had recently told him how concerned she was about drug addiction and mental health in the country  It struck a chord “I was adopted into a family where my mom suffered alcohol and prescription drug addiction ” he said  “And  on one very sad occasion  she tried to take her own life ”Mr  Vilsack recalled how the last conversation he had with his father before he died was about the cost of law school  then noted Mrs  Clinton’s plan for easing student debt And  he said  “she understands loyalty ” She first took interest in him and his fledgling campaign in 1998  he said  “24 years before that  she met my brother in

Vermont in the late 1960s to help plan the upending of the old social order  the future presidential candidate Bernie Sanders brought with him the belief that the United States was starkly divided into two groups  the establishment and the revolutionaries  He was a revolutionary “The Revolution Is Life Versus Death ” in fact  was the title of an article he wrote for The Vermont Freeman  an alternative  authority challenging newspaper published for a few years back then  The piece began with an apocalyptically alarmist account of the unbearable horror of having an office job in New York City  of being among “the mass of hot dazed humanity heading uptown for the 9 5 ” sentenced to endless days of “moron work  monotonous work ”“The years come and go ” Mr  Sanders wrote  in all apparent seriousness  “Suicide  nervous breakdown  cancer  sexual deadness  heart attack  alcoholism  senility at 50  Slow death  fast death  DEATH ”Chalk some of this up to being young and unemployed  Mr  Sanders  now 73  has had a steady  nonrevolutionary job for quite some time now  His current workplace  the United States Senate  is not exactly known for its thrill a minute dynamism  But through his long evolution from outraged outsider to mainstream man in a suit  Mr  Sanders has remained true to his original message  sympathy for the downtrodden  the impoverished and the disenfranchised in the face of the rich and the powerful Back then  he was part of a crowd of like minded young people who converged on Burlington at a time when America seemed to be rewriting its history on the spot  Students  hippies  labor organizers  trust fund kids  urban escapees  impoverished anti Vietnam War campaigners and environmentalists yearning to be closer to the land — they came because they believed that change was coming and that they had found the right place for a revolution Mr  Sanders was barely 30  full of restless energy  with wild curly hair  a brash Brooklyn manner and a mind fizzing with plans to remake the world  Short on money but long on ideas  he found employment where he could  supporting himself through odd jobs like carpentry work “Freelance journalist” has always been on the list of things he did before he began running for statewide office  futilely  as a Liberty Union Party candidate in the 1970s  But the description is a bit of a stretch  A look through his journalistic output  such as it was  reveals that he had perhaps a dozen articles published — interviews  essays  state of the nation diatribes — most in The Freeman They provide a useful insight into the formative thinking of the man who would go on to become Burlington’s first socialist mayor  then a senator and now a presidential candidate who is drawing crowds in the thousands with his unapologetic leftist message  The writings also reflect the particular mood in this one little spot in Vermont in an era of extraordinary turmoil in America  when the social fabric seemed in danger of ripping apart over issues like the Vietnam War  race and poverty Among Mr  Sanders’s efforts was a 1972 essay on sexual politics  “Man — and Woman ” which drew unflattering attention recently after Mother Jones magazine included it in an article about him  Its opening passage  which deals with men’s sexual fantasies  is meant to be satirically provocative but comes across as crassly sexist   Mr  Sanders’ underlying point  expressed less feverishly farther down in the article  is that men and women should rethink how they deal with one another  Another essay mocked what Mr  Sanders felt to be the soul destroying nature of conventional education “If children of 5 are not taught to obey orders  sit still for 7 hours a day  respect their teacher  and raise their hands when they have to go to the bathroom  how will they learn  after 17 more years of education  to become the respectful clerks  technicians and soldiers who keep our society free  our economy strong  and such inspiring men as Richard Nixon and Deane Davis in political office ” Mr  Sanders wrote  referring to the president and the Vermont governor at the time People in Mr  Sanders’s circle back then remember visiting the future senator at his small apartment in Burlington  “It was subsistence living ” said Greg Guma  the author of “The People’s Republic  Vermont and the Sanders Revolution ”Mr  Guma knew the young Mr  Sanders as a kitchen table fulminator and political organizer  not as a writer  At their first meeting  he recalled  Mr  Sanders “kind of berated me” when Mr  Guma asked who he was “He said he was unimportant and it was all about the movement  and then it kind of escalated  ‘If you don’t support the movement  I don’t want your vote ’ ” Mr  Guma said  “Obviously he’s become more adept at cultivating voters ”Mr  Sanders’s articles in The Freeman were consistent with the newspaper’s ethos  The paper  which had humble production values and cost  10 for a year’s subscription in 1971  was founded in 1969 by Roger L  Albright  a former minister  as a place for like minded leftists to opine in outraged tones about the issues of the day  Often  apparently  they did it for free “Pay? You’ve got to be kidding — I don’t recall ever getting paid ” said Marvin Fishman  now 77  who wrote about prison issues for the paper   He had spent a year in prison on a marijuana charge  “We were broke  they were broke  everybody was broke ” said Frank Kochman  who was recruited for the paper when Mr  Albright rescued his stranded Volkswagen bug from a snowbank  and who was its general manager and co publisher from 1971 to 1973  “If we had a little money  we’d try to pay something ”Mr  Sanders contributed only sporadically  He interviewed a “labor agitator” and an old time farmer  and he wrote some articles about health  including one in which he cited studies claiming that cancer could be caused by psychological factors such as unresolved hostility toward one’s mother  a tendency to bury aggression beneath a “facade of pleasantness” and having too few orgasms “Sexual adjustment seemed to be very poor in those with cancer of the cervix ” he wrote  quoting a study in a journal called Psychosomatic Medicine One article  to observe the 10th anniversary of the Cuban revolution  argued that despite its many failings  Cuba had made great progress in health care and education  “The American press and mass media have been stepping up their usual distorted and inaccurate reporting ” he wrote In “Reflections on a Dying Society ” he declared that the United States was virtually going to hell in a handcart  Its food was laden with chemicals  its environment was being ruined  the threat of nuclear annihilation or “death by poison gas” was increasing  people were suffering from malaise and “psychosomatic disease”  citizens were being coerced and duped by the government and the advertising industry  and the economy was based on “useless” goods “designed to break down or used for the slaughter of people ”“The general social situation  to say the least ” he wrote  “does not look good ”Later in the 1970s  Mr  Sanders took a steady job with a Liberty Union colleague making filmstrips about important events in American history  many from the colonial period  and selling them door to door to schools   He also made a half hour film about his hero  Eugene V  Debs  the labor organizer who ran unsuccessfully for president five times   They worked on a shoestring out of Mr  Sanders’s house  said the colleague  Ron MacNeil “I think our motivation was that we were interested in American history ” Mr  MacNeil said But that was after Mr  Sanders had run  and lost  various statewide races as a Liberty Union candidate  By 1972  when he ran as the party’s candidate for senator and governor  he lost both races by very wide margins   he had begun publishing The Movement  an occasional newsletter He put together the whole thing himself  said Doris Lake  another early Liberty Union candidate  and focused on the issues that were consuming him  One edition included a letter Ms  Lake had written to her supervisor  and had shown to Mr  Sanders  complaining about working conditions in the eyeglass lens factory where she worked the night shift  Ms  Lake said But for Mr  Sanders  everything was about ideas to make the world better  both in real life and in The Movement “I believe there was a lot of editorializing on philosophy ” Ms  Lake said  “At the time  we were thinking that the important thing in politics was to educate people  to get them to understand what was happening in the world  rather than to get elected ”","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders’s Revolutionary Roots Were Nurtured in ’60s Vermont","print_headline":"Outsider Went Mainstream, but Message Changed Little"},"wordCount":"1438"},

Sanders of Vermont edged closer on Friday to directly attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton  pointedly asking whether the Democratic presidential front runner would support measures to break up the country’s largest financial institutions and reinstate a firewall between commercial and investment banking Mr  Sanders  whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has galvanized liberal activists driven by questions of economic fairness  highlighted his efforts to cut down the so called too big to fail banks and restore Glass Steagall  the Depression era banking law repealed under President Bill Clinton  “You’ll have to ask Hillary Clinton about her views on whether she thinks we should break up these large financial institutions  I do ” Mr  Sanders  an independent  said at a news conference here  “You will have to ask her views on whether we should re establish Glass Steagall ”He boasted that he had not received financial contributions from Goldman Sachs  which he said sought “undue influence” in American politics  but stopped short of calling on Mrs  Clinton to reject the nearly  50 000 in donations she has received from employees of the Wall Street firm  “That’s her decision ” Mr  Sanders said  after pausing for a moment to consider the question Mr  Sanders spoke the afternoon before the Iowa Democratic Party’s annual fund raising dinner  the first event this year at which all of the party’s five presidential candidates appeared together  Mrs  Clinton addressed her supporters at an early evening rally before the banquet  but trained her fire entirely on Republicans  making no mention  direct or implied  of Mr  Sanders The banquet illustrated the populist fervor coursing through the Democratic base  offering an explanation for Mr  Sanders’ early success  Mrs  Clinton received ovations for her attacks on some of the Republican presidential hopefuls and gender oriented appeals  but Mr  Sanders and Martin O’Malley  a former Maryland governor  found booming applause for their full throated attacks on Wall Street and free trade deals Asked whether Mrs  Clinton would seek to break up the country’s largest banks or reinstate Glass Steagall  an aide to Mrs  Clinton said she would speak in more detail about both issues in the coming weeks   Alan Blinder  an economist who is advising Mrs  Clinton  said this week that she would not attempt to revive Glass Steagall  While some leading Iowa Democrats believe that Mr  Sanders’s rise will ultimately help Mrs  Clinton restrain expectations here  where she was defeated by Barack Obama in the 2008 caucuses  Mr  Sanders’s growing support in the polls  vast base of small dollar contributors and sizable crowds have prompted some of Mrs  Clinton’s backers to make not so subtle comments about the importance of nominating a candidate who can capture the White House “We’ve got to nominate somebody that can win and Hillary is a winner ” Michael Fitzgerald  Iowa’s state treasurer  said at the Clinton rally “I don’t have a lot of time to mess around like I used to  I want to win ” said Dale Todd  a Democratic activist from Cedar Rapids  who also spoke before Mrs  Clinton took the stage Privately  Mrs  Clinton’s backers are blunter  dismissing the possibility that Mr  Sanders  a 73 year old self declared socialist  would be a viable general election candidate  Yet the sheer size of his crowds  in Iowa and beyond  is creating awkwardness for Mrs  Clinton She added the rally to her schedule  her campaign said  to give local supporters who had not purchased a ticket for the dinner a chance to see the former secretary of state  She has been doing more such large scale events in part because they are crucial to organizing  To that end  every attendee was asked to sign a caucus commitment card upon entering the basement hall  one side of which was lined with a surefire crowd builder  boxes of free pizza These gatherings also  though  represent an effort to show that Mrs  Clinton is herself capable of luring big audiences  But the rally served to highlight her inability for now to attract crowds on the same scale as Mr  Sanders  whose Iowa events have drawn more people than any other presidential candidate has in either party  Mrs  Clinton drew a few hundred people to her event here — her campaign pegged it at 500 — while Mr  Sanders was met by about 2 500 at an event in Council Bluffs this month  The Vermont senator did not seek to compete with a head to head rally  but he joined a group of veterans Friday afternoon upstairs in the same building where Mrs  Clinton spoke Standing beneath a giant  Grant Wood designed stained glass window honoring three centuries of American soldiers  Mr  Sanders recounted his work as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee  solemnly recounting “the cost of war ” But he turned notably more energetic when he took questions about his campaign “I think that there is a growing frustration all over this country for establishment politics  for establishment economics ” he said before inveighing against what he called “a corrupt system ”","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders Presses Hillary Clinton on

political dynamic on Wednesday after Hillary Clinton reasserted her command of the Democratic Party presidential race during a debate that may have left little room for him to run Analysts widely hailed Clinton  67  as turning in a nimble  effective performance on Tuesday night  perhaps easing the fears of some Democrats fretting that the flap over her use of a private email server while in the Obama administration was torpedoing her candidacy for the November 2016 election In doing so  she may have dampened calls for Biden to make a belated entrance into the race while also blunting the threat from insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders  a 74 year old U S  senator from Vermont and self described democratic socialist “If you’re a Hillary supporter and you were worried for whatever reason  you should feel very good about yourself ” said Rodell Mollineau  a Democratic strategist who attended the televised debate in Las Vegas  “This is the kind of debate that helps build momentum ”Sanders  Clinton’s top rival among declared candidates  was handed the opportunity by debate moderators to assail her over the email issue  Instead  he dismissed the controversy as trivial  drawing an ovation from the crowd and shoving the spotlight away from Clinton’s most profound political weakness For Biden  72  who continues to ponder a bid for the presidency  the evening served as a reminder of how tenacious Clinton can be as a candidate  steeled by scores of debates in her 2008 presidential run and four years as secretary of state At times  Clinton seemed to be reaching out both to the progressives in her party more likely to back Sanders and the moderates who may prefer Biden She went toe to toe with Sanders over gun control  addressed income inequality and advocated for more liberal family leave policies At the same time  she refused to go along with Sanders’ call to break up Wall Street banks  reiterated her support of the Patriot Act  and said she would not hesitate to use military force if necessary  at times obliquely criticizing President Barack Obama's White House and  by proxy  Biden for failing to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and for doing too little about the civil war in Syria Biden mentioned the debate in remarks to reporters on Wednesday but gave no indication of whether he will enter the race \"I thought every one of those folks last night      I thought they all did well \" he said after a speech in Washington about transportation investment Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta said Biden needs to decide now whether to run or not \"This debate has been joined  We're talking about different ideas about how to take the country forward  how to improve and build upon what President Obama has achieved  And if Vice President Biden wants to enter and compete for the presidency then it is time for him to make that decision \" he told MSNBC The debate attracted a record 15 3 million viewers  host CNN said on Wednesday  citing Nielsen data  That is the highest audience for a Democratic presidential debate on cable news but is still lower than the ratings for the Republicans' first two 2016 election debates earlier this year SANDERS' LIMITSTuesday's debate may also have exposed Sanders’ limitations  As a candidate  he has made populist economic themes central to his campaign  almost to the exclusion of other issues  His discomfort on guns   his home state of Vermont is protective of gun rights   and with foreign policy seemed evident  At one point  Sanders loudly protested he is not a pacifist “He didn’t handle himself well on guns or on foreign policy ” said Brad Bannon  a Democratic strategist in Washington  “He seemed flustered and defensive  Americans want someone calm and collected when dealing with a crisis ”Republican front runner Donald Trump declared Clinton the winner of the encounter  in part because the other Democrats did not put her under much pressure “It was a very kind debate  very gentle  She came out the winner \" Trump told ABC News But Clinton did give Republicans ammunition as she came out strongly in favor of gun control and tighter regulation of banks  and brushed off former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee's concerns about her email use \"Clinton’s record of hypocrisy and flip flops on everything from Wall Street  trade  immigration  and foreign policy was on full display  Her unwillingness to fully explain the circumstances surrounding her secret email server  and the ongoing FBI investigation into it  further damages her credibility \" Reince Priebus  head of the Republican National Committee  said in a statement Democratic hopeful Jim Webb  a former senator from Virginia  may have delivered the most scathing indictment of Sanders’ candidacy  telling him at one point in the debate  “Bernie  I don’t think the revolution is going to come ”Still  Sanders’ liberal base likely saw little to prompt a second thought about supporting him  “It was a good night for him too ” said Stephanie Taylor  co founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee  who also praised Clinton She said the scrutiny of Sanders’ positions on guns and national security demonstrated his viability as a top tier candidate and alternative to Clinton  “People were attacking him like he is the front runner ” This story has been refiled to add dropped title and

said on Tuesday that they would vote against a resolution putting Congress on record against the Iran deal  becoming the 32nd and 33rd Democrats to do so  Thirty four votes are needed to sustain a presidential veto if the resolution of disapproval passes Now attention is turned to the 11 Democrats who have not officially disclosed their view  several of whom are widely expected to back the agreement Senator Benjamin L  Cardin of Maryland  the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee  has public appearances on Wednesday  but indications are that he will not announce his position on the Iran deal  Other Democratic senators being watched closely include Barbara A  Mikulski of Maryland  Joe Manchin III of West Virginia  who is believed to be leaning toward supporting the deal  Mark Warner of Virginia  Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  and Gary Peters of Michigan In the House  Democrats have maintained a steady parade in favor of the deal  and supporters of the president are optimistic they can keep Republicans from getting near the 290 votes required to override a presidential veto there  And if the House can sustain the veto  the Senate wouldn’t even have to vote a second time  With the votes to sustain a veto almost in hand  some Democrats are now pushing for the party to filibuster the deal on the Senate floor  avoiding a veto fight they say could

attorney general of Delaware and the elder son of Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   died on Saturday in Bethesda  Md  He was 46 The cause was brain cancer  his father said Mr  Biden had spent more than a week receiving treatment at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center  where he died In a statement Saturday night  the vice president said  “It is with broken hearts that Hallie  Hunter  Ashley  Jill and I announce the passing of our husband  brother and son  Beau  after he battled brain cancer with the same integrity  courage and strength he demonstrated every day of his life ”The statement went on to say  “In the words of the Biden family  Beau Biden was  quite simply  the finest man any of us have ever known ”In 2010  the younger Mr  Biden  known as Beau  had suffered what officials described as a mild stroke  Three years later  he was admitted to the University of Texas M  D  Anderson Cancer Center in Houston after what White House officials described at the time as “an episode of disorientation and weakness ”Officials said in 2013 that the doctors in Texas had removed a small lesion from his brain Mr  Biden’s death is a second tragic loss for the vice president  whose first wife  Neilia  and 13 month old daughter  Naomi  were killed in a car accident in 1972 when the station wagon they were driving in to go Christmas shopping was hit by a tractor trailer  Beau Biden and his brother  Hunter  were also injured in the crash  but both survived A popular Democratic politician in his home state  who was known to be very close to his father  Mr  Biden served two terms as Delaware’s top law enforcement official before announcing last year that he would not run for a third term so he could make a bid for governor in 2016 “What started as a thought — a very persistent thought — has now become a course of action that I wish to pursue ” Mr  Biden wrote in an open letter to his constituents in April 2014 As recently as late February  some Delaware politicians close to Mr  Biden told news organizations that they still believed Mr  Biden planned to run for governor  But Mr  Biden’s health had apparently declined in recent weeks  and he was taken to Walter Reed this month Born on Feb  3  1969  in Wilmington  Del   Joseph Robinette Biden III was an energetic politician whose broad smile mirrored that of his father  He appeared to be a natural to follow his father’s path toward national political success A lawyer by training  Mr  Biden joined the Delaware National Guard in 2003  serving as a major in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps  His unit was deployed to Iraq in 2008  while his father was running for vice president  He was also a Bronze Star recipient In a short  emotional speech introducing his father at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver  Mr  Biden recalled the tragedy that had touched his family  describing the moments after the crash “One of my earliest memories was being in that hospital  Dad always at our side  We  not the Senate  were all he cared about ” Mr  Biden said  “He decided not to take the oath of office  He said  ‘Delaware can get another senator  but my boys can’t get another father ’ However  great men like Ted Kennedy  Mike Mansfield  Hubert Humphrey — men who had been tested themselves — convinced him to serve  So he was sworn in  in the hospital  at my bedside ”Many in Delaware expected Mr  Biden to run for his father’s Senate seat after the 2008 election  but the younger Biden  who was elected attorney general in 2006  declined  saying he was still needed in his state as he pressed ahead on a major child molestation case his agency was pursuing against a pediatrician “I have a duty to fulfill as attorney general  and the immediate need to focus on a case of great consequence  And that is what I must do ”He ran for re election in 2010  serving a second term before deciding to seek higher office Mr  Biden  who lived in Greenville  Del   is survived by his wife

the Bidens on Sunday  spending about a half hour at the vice president’s residence at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington Earlier  the president said in a statement that he was grieving for the vice president and his family  “For all that Beau Biden achieved in his life  nothing made him prouder  nothing made him happier  nothing claimed a fuller focus of his love and devotion than his family ” Mr  Obama said  “Just like his dad ”In an outpouring of sympathy  many people on Twitter posted links to the vice president’s graduation speech at Yale University in May  Mr  Biden spoke at length about the tragedies he had endured and the ways they had made him stronger “Six weeks after my election  my whole world was altered forever ” he said  referring to his election to the Senate in 1972 and the crash that killed his wife and infant daughter  He said he had found redemption by focusing on his sons “I can remember my mother  a sweet lady  looking at me after we left the hospital and saying  ‘Joey  out of everything terrible that happens to you  something good will come if you look hard enough for it ’ ” Mr  Biden told the Yale graduates  “She was right ”Mr  Biden reflected on his decision to travel home to Delaware each night even as he served in the Senate  Some said it suggested a lack of ambition  he noted  an indication that he was not serious about success as a national politician “But looking back on it ” Mr  Biden said  “the truth be told  the real reason I went home every night was that I needed my children more than they needed me ”In a statement Sunday morning  Secretary of State John Kerry quoted the vice president as once saying that after losing a loved one  “there is a black hole you feel in your chest  like you’re being sucked back into it ” But Mr  Kerry added that “Joe has also said there comes a day ‘when the thought of your son or daughter  or your husband or wife  brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to

Nice guy wanders into mess and truth is revealed We’ve had  for example  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarifying the fact that  “Israel and the U S  have mutual interests  but we will act according to the vital interests of the state of Israel ”Of course  the United States  too  has “vital interests ” They include reaching a two state solution between Israel and Palestine for which the physical space erodes daily as Israeli settlements in the West Bank expand Peace is a vital American interest for many reasons  including its inalienable commitment to Israel’s long term security  but the most pressing is that the conflict is a jihadist recruitment tool that feeds the wars in which young Americans die This is not rocket science  Yet over the past decade the United States has been facilitating the costly settlements enterprise by pouring  28 9 billion into Israel  America’s strategic goal of Israeli and Palestinian states living side by side in security has been undermined by its own blank check diplomacy Well  goodbye to all that — maybe  Something shifted when Biden  “You need not be a Jew to be a Zionist”  was thanked for his unstinting support of Israel with a snub  The announcement that another 1 600 apartments for Jews will be built in east Jerusalem  a pure provocation when restarting peace talks is the core U S  aim President Barack Obama was furious  In a top down administration like this one  you don’t get Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lambasting Netanyahu for 43 minutes and David Axelrod  a senior White House adviser  speaking of “an affront” and “an insult” and a “very  very destructive” step if America’s measured leader is not immeasurably incensed  That truth is also worth knowing Obama has reason to be angry Netanyahu  betraying the growing Israeli taste for the status quo  torn between rightist instincts and coalition partners on the one hand and his ego’s sensitivity to the peacemaker’s halo and history books on the other  has been toying with Obama A year ago  in March 2009  I wrote that  “Obama’s new policies of Middle Eastern diplomacy and engagement” would involve “a probable cooling of U S  Israeli relations ” I believed that Israel had misread or underestimated a core strategic shift of the Obama presidency  away from the with us or against us rhetoric of the war on terror toward a rapprochement with the Muslim world as the basis for isolating terrorists Well  here’s the cooling  You can’t have rapprochement with Muslims while condoning the steady Israeli appropriation of the physical space for Palestine  You can’t have that rapprochement if U S  policy is susceptible to the whims of Shas  the Sephardic ultra Orthodox party in Netanyahu’s coalition that runs the Interior Ministry and announced the Biden baiting measure The Israeli right  whether religious or secular  has no interest in a two state peace  I had lunch the other day with Ron Nachman  the mayor of Ariel  one of the largest West Bank settlements  He told me breezily that there “can be no Palestinian state ” and that “Israel and Jordan should divide the land ” I liked his frankness  It clarifies things It’s time for equal frankness from Netanyahu  Do “the vital interests of the state of Israel” include continued building in East Jerusalem and the steady takeover of the West Bank  or does his embrace of the airy phrase  “two states for two peoples ” have more than camouflage meaning?Netanyahu’s apology is not enough  The United States is asking for “specific actions ” I’d say at a minimum that would include the annulment of the 1 600 apartments plan  Israel  always ready to mock Palestinian disarray  might also ensure that its leader knows what members of his own government are doing This is a watershed moment  Palestinian violence  Palestinian anti Semitic incitement and jihadist infiltration of the Palestinian national movement all undermine peace efforts  They are unacceptable  Biden was right to “ironclad” the U S  commitment to Israeli security  But it’s past time that Palestinian failings cease to serve as an excuse for Israel’s remorseless  cynical scattering of the Palestinian people into enclaves that make a farce of statehood  That is “an affront” to America In this sense  Biden’s foray has been salutary  It brought U S  “vital interests” to the surface  It challenged Israel’s ostrich like burrowing into polices that  over time  will make one divided  undemocratic state more likely than “two states for two peoples ” It asked again the question posed recently by David Shulman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Are Israelis  cocooned  still able “to see  to imagine  and to acknowledge the suffering of other human beings  including those aspects of their suffering for which we are directly responsible?”The mass market daily Maariv had a  front page post Biden cartoon of Obama cooking Netanyahu in a pot  It was supposed to illustrate a relationship “in

thought he didn’t need much in the way of preparation  This was back when Tiger Woods was winning everything  I dug up some footage of the champion golfer at the driving range and gave it to my client  who was running for office  The message was clear  Even the best realize they get better with practice  He agreed to prep Can you actually get better at running for president?Like most things in life  candidates do tend to improve with experience  That’s one of the reasons one fourth of our presidents lost in previous bids before winning  Most recently  Richard M  Nixon  Ronald Reagan and George H  W  Bush all ran and lost before winning  According to analysis by The Washington Post  first time general election candidates win just under 25 percent of the time  while running twice increases the odds to 63 5 percent Campaigning for president is an incredibly difficult endeavor  Compared with a race for the governor’s office or a Senate seat  it is the difference between junior high sports and the pros  We’ve seen this repeatedly in modern presidential politics when successful statewide candidates  from the hero astronaut John Glenn to veterans of tough state elections like Gov  Scott Walker  prove unprepared for the presidential field As with sports  some competitors are more gifted than others — both George W  Bush and Barack Obama landed in the White House on their first try — but all who succeed recognize one essential truth  This is a humbling process that demands constant improvement In the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas last week  Hillary Rodham Clinton used the proof point that she had stood “on a debate stage  I think  about 25 times with then Senator Obama” to reassure voters that he trusted her judgment on foreign policy when he chose her as secretary of state  and so should they  But it was also a reminder that she had been tested in the gantlet of a presidential campaign  She was assuring voters  “I’ve done this  trust me  I can win ”And she’s got a point  A candidate for president must be much more than an inspiring campaigner with a good message  Today  successful candidates are chief executives of a billion dollar start up business that has been likened to building an airplane while it’s in the air  And every day they have to go out and interact with voters in a political world in which being “normal” is highly valued  even though they are running for the most abnormal job in the world Political insiders call the presidential cycle “the freak show ” that crazy place down the midway where the bizarre meets the unknown  As with sex or combat  the first experience will always be the most anxiety inducing and confusing Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who is still apparently mulling a run  has been through it all  from bouncing out of a 1988 race after a plagiarism scandal to an anemic showing in 2008 resurrected by a spot on the winning ticket  Like Mrs  Clinton  he’s been through the Freak Show  Both know what to expect On the Republican side  only Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are presidential campaign veterans  though the odds that they will be nominees are only slightly better than Lincoln Chafee’s   My consulting firm is working with Chris Christie  though I am not directly involved in his campaign   At the moment  Republican voters seem to love the first time candidates Donald J  Trump and Ben Carson  But those candidates’ willingness to put up with what a campaign demands is already being tested  Mr  Trump is complaining that the debates are too long  and Mr  Carson seems to be taking a detour to sell books Every cycle  presidential campaigns seem to get more difficult  Now every voter is also a citizen reporter with a video camera  and the most casual of exchanges can make for YouTube fun  In 2008  Mr  Obama  then a senator  became the first presidential nominee to opt out of the federal funding system since it was created in 1976  Candidates have continued to opt out  leaving them to raise money through Election Day Having worked for presidential campaigns both in the federal funding system and not  I can attest that it’s much more demanding on candidates to be forced to spend more than 50 percent of their time raising campaign money after the convention  which the federal funding system used to prevent  Jeb Bush tried to front load his fund raising to focus more on campaigning  but if he’s the nominee  he’ll have to do both at a frenetic pace  As he has said  it’s been a long time since he has run for office  and the process — and the Republican Party — have greatly changed Nothing helps prepare for debates like debating  but all debates are not equal  The stage for the Republican debates is likely to remain crowded for most of primary season  denying the eventual nominee a chance to prep for the high pressure one on one debates of the general election  In the smaller Democratic debate  Mrs  Clinton spoke for about 30 minutes  twice the amount of time Mr  Bush spoke and almost three times more than Marco Rubio In the 2012 primaries  the Romney campaign did only one or two mock debates to prepare for the more than two dozen debates Mr  Romney entered  With a huge cast  mock debates proved essentially impossible  But for the general election debates  Mr  Romney prepared with realistic mock debates  adjusting to the different dynamic of one on one  With fewer debates this year  the Republican nominee will need to devote serious preparation to facing a Democratic candidate who is likely to be a more veteran debater Mr  Romney learned a great deal from running in 2008  For one thing  he realized how difficult it was  And for him  like a lot of successful businesspeople  the notion that he could win primaries with  say  35 percent of the vote was a strange concept  He was accustomed to going into markets or businesses where the goal was 90 percent market share  But the quickest way for any candidate to get only 20 percent is to aim for 90 It takes tremendous confidence to run for president  But to be successful  that confidence must be matched with a realistic self criticism In 2012  after every debate  Mr  Romney had little interest in hearing praise for what he had done best but instead focused on moments he felt he could have done better  In a long campaign  there’s rarely a bad moment for which a candidate cannot find a reason to blame his staff  often with justification  But the best candidates are the ones who can look at themselves  and analyze what they did wrong and adjust Candidates are like sports teams  They are either improving or getting worse  never static  As the campaign unfolds  watch your favorite candidate for signs of improvement  and if you don’t see it  you’re probably pulling for a loser

Wednesday morning from what scientists now say is a dying universe and where Donald J  Trump remains the leader in Republican polls  But while he dabbled in policy discussions and held a large rally in Michigan on Tuesday  one of his major rivals  Jeb Bush  regained some of the spotlight by attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton over the Obama administration’s policies in the Middle East Republican attacks on Mrs  Clinton’s lucrative speeches and her comment that she was “dead broke” seem quaint compared with linking her to the violence  beheadings and instability sweeping the Middle East On Tuesday  Mr  Bush ushered in a new phase of the campaign  where Mrs  Clinton’s record at the State Department will face intense scrutiny for the rise of the Islamic State and the violence engulfing Syria and Iraq In a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley  Calif   Mr  Bush said Mrs  Clinton “stood by” as secretary of state as the situation in Iraq worsened and the Obama administration pulled troops out  a vacuum that he said the Islamic State had rushed in to fill The Clinton campaign  in turn  cast the blame further back  saying that President George W  Bush’s decision to invade Iraq in the first place created the group  “ISIS grew out of Al Qaeda in Iraq ” said Jake Sullivan  the Clinton campaign’s senior policy adviser  “It emerged in no small part as a result of President Bush’s failed strategy ”Mrs  Clinton  whose vote to authorize the war in Iraq hurt her in the 2008 Democratic nominating contest  hardly talks about foreign policy or her time at the State Department  Instead  she devotes her town hall style events and speeches to policy areas like the economy  the environment and her new college affordability plan But as Mr  Bush made clear on Tuesday  Republicans will press the issue with Mrs  Clinton on foreign policy and over the Obama administration’s approach — whether over the spread of the Islamic State  the “reset” of relations with Russia or the nuclear deal with Iran — Amy ChozickStay tuned throughout the day  Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates Mr  Bush  whose campaign this summer unsuccessfully pushed for Nevada to switch from a caucus system to a primary and who recently chose leaders to run campaign operations in all of the state’s counties  will hold a rally in Reno and a town hall style event in Las Vegas later in the day And Rick Santorum  who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012  but whose poll numbers left him out of the top 10 for last week’s Republican debate  continues a sustained trip in the state  all part of his goal  his campaign says  “to reach all 99 Iowa counties ”After a quiet but relatively well received performance at the debate  Ben Carson is headed to Harlem Mr  Carson will speak with Harlem residents on Wednesday at Sylvia’s Restaurant  well known for its Southern comfort food  where photos of President Obama  former President Bill Clinton  the Rev  Al Sharpton and Representative Charles B  Rangel  all Democrats  hang on the walls “This is a private event ” said a woman who answered the phone at Sylvia’s  “They called us up and booked the private area ” she added  before emphasizing that hosting the event did not represent an endorsement On Sunday  Mr  Carson  a retired neurosurgeon whose best moment in the debate came when he said he was the only candidate who had separated conjoined twins  visited a church in Iowa where he spoke about his faith He told the congregation of growing up poor in Detroit  how much he hated it and of how he found God in trying to deal with his temper  Despite his lengthy medical résumé  he has not held public office and has relied heavily on his personal narrative “Dr  Carson is not here to campaign ” the church’s pastor said  according to The Des Moines Register  “We’re not saying go vote for Dr  Carson  We’re saying here’s a man who walks humbly before his God  who has an incredible message not only for us but for our country ”The Sylvia’s event is another chance for him to introduce himself to voters  And Harlem  home to the country’s first black renaissance  may also offer a stage to discuss the Black Lives Matter movement  a subject Mr  Carson  the only black candidate in either party  has touched on only briefly “He is not here to make statements ” a spokeswoman  Deana Bass  said  “This is a meet and greet for him to visit the restaurant and chat with residents  It is nothing extra ”— Sandra E  GarciaGov  John R  Kasich of Ohio came to a Peterborough  N H   event on Tuesday with a take the high road answer prepared for questions about Mr  Trump “I don’t have time to talk about somebody else ” Mr  Kasich said  adding that he was fully occupied  like Mr  Carson  with introducing himself to voters Responding to a question from a voter about how he had similarly deflected the topic of Mr  Trump in a CNN interview  Mr  Kasich even avoided mentioning the unlikely Republican poll leader by name For a while  that is He eventually gave in to temptation  after uncorking a metaphor about how his much praised debate performance was akin to being an astronaut launched in a rocket ship “Thank God for Donald Trump  24 million people tuned in ” Mr  Kasich said  drawing knowing laughs about the Trump inflated audience — Jonathan MartinSenator Marco Rubio of Florida’s presidential campaign so far has been a lot of fits and starts  It impresses  it raises expectations  then it goes quiet  And it’s all part of the plan Responding to a New York Times Magazine article on efforts to undermine the 1965 Voting Rights Act  Mr  Obama wrote a letter to the editor  arguing that voting rights must be “vigorously defended” and calling on Congress to restore the law in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated crucial parts of it Mrs  Clinton has directed aides to give an email server and a thumb drive to the Justice Department as the inspector general for the intelligence community told members of Congress that two of the former secretary of state’s emails among the 40 he has reviewed held classified information And if there is a war between Mr  Trump and Fox News  it is an unconventional one  It is not mutually assured destruction  it is mutually beneficial combat Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont continues to not only draw the kind of large crowds that other candidates dream of  but also gain ground on Mrs  Clinton in polls  The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times take a look at his success Politico reports that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  who is the highest ranking Democrat to come out against the Iran nuclear deal  and is expected to be among the lead contenders to take over the party’s Senate leadership when Senator Harry Reid of Nevada steps down  has been “working the phones” to explain his decision and to assure Democrats that he will not try to secure more no votes And Mr  Bush‘s Middle East policy attacks against Mrs  Clinton  Slate argues  will put her in the position of having to choose between defending herself and criticizing Mr  Obama during the Democratic contest Mr  Trump may have a lot of money  but he is refusing to spend it on his campaign  like by buying television ads  spending on ballot access  or paying for campaign rallies  The Wall Street Journal reports The fact that former Gov  Rick Perry of Texas  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky  and Mr  Santorum are continuing their campaigns despite fund raising woes shows how “super PACs” can keep failing

Ford F 250 flatbed pickup truck outside  so that Mr  Cruz would have a new stage Mr  Hendrix was happy to oblige  as both a Republican and a friend of the owner  but he didn’t know Mr  Cruz too well  After the speech  however  his tone shifted “I was happy to have done it for him  but I didn’t start out to do it that way ” Mr  Hendrix said  But now “I really like what he has to say ”Mr  Hendrix’s cars are his life’s passion  he remembers putting his piggy bank savings into a rumble seat of the first classic car he bought with his father  a 1930 Ford Model A Roadster “For all of  21  I owned the back seat of that car ” he said If Mr  Cruz returned to Mississippi  and was in need of a classic car again  say the Roadster or any other of his fleet  could he turn to Mr  Hendrix?“Absolutely ”

trail gives way this week to Vienna  where negotiators report progress but also great distance over crucial elements of a deal to curtail Iran’s nuclear program Time is running short for the United States and Iran to reach a nuclear agreement as Republican lawmakers raise increasingly strong warnings about the deal Gathered in Vienna  negotiators were still at odds on multiple outstanding points two days before the countries’ self imposed Tuesday deadline  and Secretary of State John Kerry said it was not a sure thing that a final agreement could be achieved despite indications from the Iranian side that a compromise over its nuclear abilities was within reach At the same time  Senator Bob Corker  the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee  reiterated his concern that Mr  Kerry and the Obama administration were more interested in coming to terms with Iran for the sake of a legacy burnishing diplomatic success than in imposing the most stringent requirements possible on Iran Appearing on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday  Mr  Corker also ticked off elements of an agreement that Republicans would be looking for if and when it reached Capitol Hill  Will the agreement allow “anytime  anywhere” inspections of Iranian facilities  and will there be an assessment and acknowledgment of the previous military aspects of Iran’s nuclear program?He suggested that the administration was rushing to a meet the deadline and deliver a deal to Congress by Thursday to limit the House and Senate’s review time to 30 days rather than the 60 days lawmakers would be allowed if the negotiations ran longer Administration allies said they expected a deal given the significant White House investment  If Congress does review an agreement  Mr  Obama will find

spread on Twitter of journalists — including this one — being separated from her with a length of rope as she marched in a parade on Saturday The images of the journalists being pulled at times by the moving rope line were discussed on the Sunday news shows It is never desirable for reporters to be part of a story  but Mrs  Clinton’s proximity to the makeshift corral  which was reinforced by her Secret Service agents  helped draw attention to it  Reporters could see Mrs  Clinton but often couldn’t hear exchanges as she briskly walked the parade  followed by supporters and a parallel band of a half dozen protesters shouting loudly “As we’ve said  we want a happy press corps ” Mrs  Clinton’s spokesman  Nick Merrill  said in a statement on Sunday “We also have to balance that with facilitating our candidate’s ability to talk to voters ” he said  “As to Saturday  we wanted to accommodate the press so they could be right there in the street with the parade  That became too disruptive to the parade  so we asked people to keep a very short distance behind a rope ”Mrs  Clinton’s aides said immediately after the parade that they wanted her to be seen and to be able to meet people along the route  A press scrum around Mrs  Clinton  who is often followed by dozens of photographers  would have prevented that  they said People involved in her 2008 run and her 2000 Senate

repeatedly side stepped questions on Sunday about how he would pay for his new plan to deport undocumented immigrants  and he also faced criticism from several rivals for the Republican presidential nomination about his call to end so called birthright citizenship for children of those immigrants Mr  Trump  the billionaire businessman whose blunt talk and outsider appeal has helped him build a lead in Republican polls  refused to provide specifics about his immigration plans during phone interviews on two Sunday news programs  ABC’s “This Week” and CBS’s “Face the Nation ” He disputed estimates that he would need hundreds of billions of dollars to deport the roughly 11 million people who are living in the United States illegally  but he declined to cite his own figures or explain where the money would come from  He promised instead that good “management ” as he put it on ABC  would fix the nation’s immigration system “My specifics are very simple ” Mr  Trump said  “I’m going to get great people that know what they’re doing  not a bunch of political hacks that have no idea what they’re doing  appointed by President Obama  that doesn’t have a clue  I mean  that man doesn’t have a clue  People are walking across the border right now  right in front of these great people that we have  We have wonderful border patrol people  They can do their job  but they’re not allowed to do the job ”Mr  Trump also said he would “expedite” the return of “good people” deported from the United States but then seek to come back – though he acknowledged that this could be seen as rewarding people who entered the United States illegally in the first place “Well  you could say that ” Mr  Trump said on “Face the Nation” in response to a question from the host  John Dickerson  “But we have lot of good people that have been here  They have done a good job  It’s a tough situation  but they have lived here sometimes for 10  15  20 years ”Mr  Trump  who has been lambasted by some of his rivals for offering simplistic ideas and being loose with his words  also suggested that there were far more illegal immigrants in the nation than widely assumed “I’ve been hearing 11 million for five years  then the other day I heard 30  Nobody has any idea ” Mr  Trump said on “This Week ”The host  George Stephanopoulos  pressed him multiple times to be more specific  asking at one point if Mr  Trump expected neighbors to start turning in neighbors to immigration authorities “I don’t know what’s going to happen ” Mr  Trump replied  before pivoting to attack other candidates like Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin  whom he accused of heeding the advice of pollsters by turning against birthright citizenship to match Mr  Trump’s position Mr  Walker  who has fallen behind Mr  Trump in some recent polls  and who appeared on “This Week” after him  was vague at first about his position on birthright citizenship  He twice refused to say if he supported the Constitution’s 14th Amendment  which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States  When asked if he would try to repeal or alter it  however  he said  “No ”“My point is any discussion that goes beyond securing the border and enforcing the laws are things that should be a red flag to voters out there  who for years have heard lip service from politicians and are understandably angry because those politicians haven’t been committed to following through on those promises ” Mr  Walker said Other Republican candidates also said they would not try to change the 14th Amendment  Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey said ending birthright citizenship was “an applause line” for Mr  Trump “It’s in the Constitution  and I don’t think that we should be looking to change it ” Mr  Christie said on “Face the Nation ” “Now  what I said was  if we wanted to have comprehensive immigration reform  I would be willing to listen to anything  But the truth of the matter is that that is not something we should be being focused on ”Carly Fiorina  appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press ” also said she would leave the Constitution alone – and suggested that Mr  Trump was playing politics with the citizenship issue rather than tackling immigration in pragmatic  specific ways “Donald Trump may not be a politician  but he’s sure acting like a politician in this regard ” she said On another issue  taxes paid by hedge fund managers  Mr  Trump took another tough stand but did not delve into details “A lot of them  it’s like they’re paper pushers – they make a fortune  they pay no tax  it’s ridiculous  OK?” Mr  Trump said on CBS  “The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder  They’re making a tremendous amount of money  They have to pay taxes  I want to lower the rates for the middle class  The middle class is the one  they’re getting absolutely destroyed ”The anti politician ethos of Mr  Trump’s candidacy has proved so popular so far  however  that Mr  Walker  for one  tried to tap into it on Sunday by criticizing Republican leaders in Congress for not replacing the Affordable Care Act “Heck  I’m angry at Washington  I’m angry at my own – my own party leadership  who told us they were going to repeal Obamacare and we still don’t see a bill on the desk of the president ” said Mr  Walker  who laid out his own health care proposals last week The benefits of being an outsider also accrued to another Republican candidate  Ben Carson  a retired neurosurgeon  whose strong poll numbers prompted this question on CNN’s “State of the Union”  Would he serve as Mr  Trump’s vice presidential candidate  or perhaps choose Mr  Trump as his running mate?“All things are possible  but it is much too early to begin such conversations ” Mr  Carson said The Sunday shows also tried to divine meaning from Vice President Joseph Biden’s private meeting on Saturday with Senator Elizabeth Warren as he considers whether to enter the race for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination  Speculation centered on the possibility of a Biden Warren ticket  although one supporter of a Biden candidate  Josh Alcorn  appearing on “Fox News Sunday ” emphasized that Mr  Biden was still simply considering the race Another Democratic candidate  former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland  said he would welcome Mr  Biden as a presidential candidate “It would be nice to have at least one more lifelong Democrat in the race ” Mr  O’Malley said on ABC  Asked if he was taking a shot at Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  a popular independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination  Mr  O’Malley said  “No  it’s a compliment to Vice President Biden for also being a lifelong Democrat ” Then he broke into a grin ","headline":{"main":"As Rivals Snipe, Donald Trump Dodges Questions on

was a political unknown just weeks ago Then with a single speech delivered as President Obama looked stonily on  he was lofted into the conservative firmament as its newest star  a renowned neurosurgeon who is black and has the credibility to attack the president on health care In his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast last month  Dr  Carson criticized the health care overhaul and higher taxes on the rich  while warning that “the P C  police are out in force at all times ”Overnight  he was embraced by conservatives including those at The Wall Street Journal editorial page  which proclaimed  “Ben Carson for President” — a suggestion Dr  Carson helped feed at a high profile gathering last weekend  the Conservative Political Action Conference  He was interrupted by sustained cheers when he coyly said  “Let’s just say if you magically put me in the White House   ”In an interview in his office at Johns Hopkins University  he said he had been told for years that he could have a political career  It would be built on his compelling personal story that began in poverty in Detroit  leading to fame through pioneering work separating conjoined twins and his own self help and inspirational books  including “America the Beautiful  Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great ”While Dr  Carson  61  said that there were better candidates out there  he did not rule out a presidential run in 2016  “Certainly if a year and a half went by and there was no one on the scene and people are still clamoring  I would have to take that into consideration ” he said in the interview  “I would never turn my back on my fellow citizens ”He is in some ways a dream candidate for Republicans  But he also fits nicely into the realm of fantasy where the very early jockeying over 2016 now plays out  No modern contender without a political résumé has ever gotten close to a major party nomination But political strategists said that outsiders can have an impact  especially when they expose the shortcomings of conventional candidates “I think it speaks to the vacuum not just in the Republican Party but in politics ” Alex Castellanos  a Republican consultant  said of Dr  Carson’s appeal  “Anybody who is serious and thoughtful and an antipolitician is the opposite of the mess we’ve got now  If you can separate two Siamese twins  maybe you can separate Democrats and Republicans in Washington ”Dr  Carson has been all but overwhelmed since his speech at the Feb  7 prayer breakfast  which exploded on YouTube and was fanned by his follow up appearances on Fox News “If you are calling with remarks regarding that speech  please do not leave a message on this voice mail ” his office recording instructs callers  referring them to a fax line and e mail address  The recording  nearly seven minutes long  also includes instructions for speaking requests  media interviews  school visits and autographs  as well as how to buy Dr  Carson’s books “and other merchandise ”Sales of “America the Beautiful ” his latest book  soared to 46 000 in the six weeks since his prayer breakfast speech  from fewer than 1 000 sold this year before to the speech  according to Nielsen BookScan “People all over the nation are starved for honesty and common sense ” Dr  Carson said in his office  He had seven pens jammed in the pocket of his physician coat  which he wore over blue scrubs and scuffed white sneakers  He spoke very softly  but not because he is shy or self deprecating  He told the CPAC audience that some of his most poignant feedback came “from older Americans who said they had given up and they were waiting to die and now they felt a sense of revival once again ”In speeches and writings  Dr  Carson describes growing up with a divorced mother whose education stopped at the third grade and who worked two  and sometimes  three jobs  He was teased as “dummy” because his grades were so bad  But his mother insisted that he and an older brother turn off the television and read  writing weekly book reports that she could only feign understanding He went to Yale and the University of Michigan Medical School  and at 33  became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins  He gained fame for a series of operations separating conjoined twins  long and risky procedures that did not always succeed  His 1996 autobiography  “Gifted Hands ” became a movie starring Cuba Gooding Jr “He is one of the acknowledged leaders of pediatric neurosurgery ” said Dr  Donlin Long  a retired chairman of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins  who first brought Dr  Carson to the department   Dr  Carson said he was a “flaming liberal” in college but became conservative through his own climb to success  “One thing I always believed strongly in was personal responsibility and hard work ” he said  “I found the Democrat Party leaving me behind on that particular issue ”With his wife  Candy  Dr  Carson founded the Carson Scholars Fund  which awards  1 000 to students to help pay for college  He has also endowed Ben Carson Reading Rooms at schools that serve disadvantaged students Although Dr  Carson is a registered independent and has declined to identify himself as a Republican  his views are solidly conservative  He belongs to a Seventh day Adventist church and says churches are better mechanisms for taking care of the poor than government He draws on the Bible’s description of tithing to argue in favor of a flat tax  a perennial favorite of conservatives  “You make  10 billion  you put in a billion  you make  10  you put in 1 ” Dr  Carson explained at the prayer breakfast  “Now some people say that’s not fair because it doesn’t hurt the guy who made 10 billion as much as the guy who makes 10  Where does it say you’ve got to hurt the guy?”Dr  Carson said that he was in the new top federal bracket for family income above  450 000 Dr  Carson also advocates an alternative to the Affordable Care Act  Most people could pay most of their medical bills through health savings accounts  he said in his office  He would eliminate Medicaid and Medicare  and for the poor  government would make the contributions to their health accounts He estimated that the cost of his treatment of a child with cancer could run as high as  300 000 including hospital and chemotherapy costs  No individual could afford so much from a health savings account  he said  but the difference could be made up by catastrophic care insurance  At CPAC  Dr  Carson told conservatives that he would retire this year  because “there are so many more things that can be done ” The hint of a political future drew appreciative cheers But he said in his office that he had decided a while ago to step back from medicine after noticing that neurosurgeons he knew died young  which he attributed to stress  His immediate plans include public speaking and promoting his education foundation As for politics  he said  “I would like to have a voice

campaigns  aides have drawn comfort from the belief that Donald J  Trump’s dominance in the polls is a political summer fling  like Herman Cain in 2011 — an unsustainable boomlet dependent on megawatt celebrity  narrow appeal and unreliable surveys of Americans with a spotty record of actually voting in primaries A growing body of evidence suggests that may be wishful thinking A review of public polling  extensive interviews with a host of his supporters in two states and a new private survey that tracks voting records all point to the conclusion that Mr  Trump has built a broad  demographically and ideologically diverse coalition  constructed around personality  not substance  that bridges demographic and political divides  In doing so  he has effectively insulated himself from the consequences of startling statements that might instantly doom rival candidates In poll after poll of Republicans  Mr  Trump leads among women  despite having used terms like “fat pigs” and “disgusting animals” to denigrate some of them  He leads among evangelical Christians  despite saying he had never had a reason to ask God for forgiveness  He leads among moderates and college educated voters  despite a populist and anti immigrant message thought to resonate most with conservatives and less affluent voters  He leads among the most frequent  likely voters  even though his appeal is greatest among those with little history of voting The unusual character of Mr  Trump’s coalition by no means guarantees his campaign will survive until next year’s primaries  let alone beyond  The diversity of his coalition could even be its undoing  if his previous support for liberal policies and donations to Democrats  for example  undermine his support among conservatives  And in the end  the polling suggests  Mr  Trump will run into a wall  Most Republicans do not support his candidacy and seem unlikely ever to do so  Even now  more say they definitely would not vote for him than say they support him But the breadth of Mr  Trump’s coalition is surprising at a time of religious  ideological and geographic divisions in the Republican Party  It suggests he has the potential to outdo the flash in the pan candidacies that roiled the last few Republican nominating contests  And it hints at the problem facing his competitors and the growing pressure on them to confront him  as several  like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker  are starting to do His support is not tethered to a single issue or sentiment  immigration  economic anxiety or an anti establishment mood  Those factors may have created conditions for his candidacy to thrive  but his personality  celebrity and boldness  not merely his populism and policy stances  have let him take advantage of them Tellingly  when asked to explain support for Mr  Trump in their own words  voters of varying backgrounds used much the same language  calling him “ballsy” and saying they admired that he “tells it like it is” and relished how he “isn’t politically correct ”Trumpism  the data and interviews suggest  is an attitude  not an ideology For voters like Jan Mannarino  a 65 year old retired teacher who drove an hour from her home in Green Oak Township  Mich   to see Mr  Trump this month  his defiance of political norms is his single greatest virtue “Even if he doesn’t win  he’s teaching other politicians to stop being politicians ” Ms  Mannarino said  “He comes on strong  He could say it gently  But I think no one would listen ”When people talk about the qualities Mr  Trump would bring to the White House  they describe the raging  merciless executive who fired people for sport on television  Some mention trips to his golf courses  which they admiringly note are impeccably run  A common refrain  “He’s a person who gets things done ”That he has no experience in government is not a liability  many say  but rather one of the main reasons they want him in Washington “We don’t need a politician for president  we need a businessman ” said Tom Krzyminski  66  a hairstylist from Bay City  Mich  “That’s what we need to get us out of the mess we’re in ”A New York Times review of nine nonpartisan national polls and more public surveys in the early nominating states shows that  thus far  Mr  Trump is outperforming his Republican rivals with constituencies they were widely expected to dominate For example  he leads Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  a hero to fiscal conservatives  among Tea Party supporters  26 percent to 13 percent  according to averages of the last nine national polls  He leads former Gov  Mike Huckabee of Arkansas  a former preacher  among evangelicals  21 percent to 12 percent  And he is ahead of Mr  Bush  the former Florida governor and a favorite of mainstream donors  among moderate Republicans  22 percent to 16 percent National polls  and both public and partisan pollsters  have struggled to unravel the precise sources of Mr  Trump’s support  leaving many to ascribe it to anger and angst in the Republican electorate  But interviews with voters highlight the degree to which his popularity hinges on personality — and offer an answer to an enduring mystery  Why haven’t Mr  Trump’s outrageous statements  his lack of loyalty to the Republican Party and his caustic attacks on rivals hurt his standing?His most offensive utterances have  for many Republicans  confirmed his status as a unique outsider willing to challenge conventions  and satisfied a craving for plain spoken directness Asked if Mr  Trump had crossed a line with his language  Carl Tomanelli  68  a retired New York City police officer in Londonderry  N H   seemed surprised by the question “People are starting to see  I believe  that all this political correctness is garbage ” he said  “I think he’s echoing what a lot of people feel and say ”Many say they support Mr  Trump because of his unusual statements  not in spite of them Lisa Carey  51  of Greenfield  N H   immediately cited Mr  Trump’s outspokenness when asked why his support remains so high “As inappropriate as some of his comments are  I think it’s stuff that a lot of people are thinking but afraid to say ” she said  “And I’m a woman ”Asked if they think his brashness would make it more difficult for him to work effectively as president  many voters argue the opposite “I want people who are negotiating with him to believe my president when he says he’s going to do something ” said Lori Szostkiewicz  54  an educator from Hampstead  N H  “I want to negotiate from a position of strength  not weakness ”In interviews with voters in Michigan and New Hampshire over the past two weeks  after events hosted by Mr  Trump  none cited his policies as chief motivation for backing him  Many pointed  instead  to his wealth  saying they believed it set him apart from career politicians and freed him of the demands of donors “He doesn’t need anybody’s money ” said Maureen Colcord  60  a clinical dietitian from Derry Even as dozens of national and state polls have charted Mr  Trump’s steady ascent  Republican campaigns have taken solace in their conviction that those surveys are flawed and misleading  In interviews  campaign pollsters argue that such polls  conducted largely by media organizations and universities  rely on feedback from many Republicans who are unlikely to vote because the polls do not verify the party registration or voting history of respondents — a fact that those conducting the surveys concede New data provided to The Times by Civis Analytics  a firm aligned with Democrats and founded by the former chief analytics officer of the Obama re election campaign  shows that there is merit to those concerns  but not enough to call Mr  Trump’s lead into question  Curious about the Republican primary landscape  the firm decided to see what it could learn from its own survey  at first for internal research purposes Unlike most public polls  Civis’s relied on a list of registered voters that included their voting histories  allowing it to measure Mr  Trump’s support among those who regularly cast ballots in primary elections The survey  which was conducted on landlines Aug  10 through Wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points  showed Mr  Trump’s support at 16 percent among registered voters who identified as Republicans  That tally is less than any public poll in more than a month  but still more than any other candidate  Ben Carson was at 11 percent  and Mr  Bush at 10 percent A poll weighted to reflect the characteristics of the adult population  like most conducted for national media organizations  would have shown Mr  Trump faring some two points better than the Civis data  which was adjusted to reflect the characteristics of registered voters who identify as Republicans  The survey included 757 Republican leaning respondents  considerably more than other polls of the Republican presidential field “In reality his real support is less than what we see in the polling today ” said Masahiko Aida  lead survey scientist for Civis The Civis poll also hinted at a potential problem for Mr  Trump  states that allow only registered Republicans to participate in nominating contests  including Iowa and Nevada  He was at 14 percent among registered Republicans in the states with party registration  compared to 18 percent of the voters who were unaffiliated with a party As expected  Mr  Trump performed best among less frequent voters  He had the support of 22 percent of Republican leaning adults who did not vote in the 2012 general election  But he still held an edge  with 15 percent  among registered Republicans who had voted in a primary since 2008 “Whether the person voted in two or eight or 12 elections  Trump leads ” Mr  Aida said His falloff in support when infrequent voters were sifted out was not unique  Support for some of Mr  Trump’s rivals  including Mr  Bush and Mr  Carson  declined by similar amounts  or even more  among the most frequent voters  Civis found Mr  Trump’s strength among less frequent voters is a challenge for his campaign  which may lack the organizing experience and infrastructure to motivate them and turn them out in large numbers for a primary or caucus But those irregular voters  like Norman Kas mikha  41  a grocer from Shelby Township  Mich   represent a real opportunity for the Republican Party  which is determined to retake the White House in 2016 after losing the last two campaigns “Right now I don’t have a second choice ” Mr  Kas mikha said  “They all blend in to me  It’s Donald Trump — and everyone else ”“My second choice ” he added  “might be staying at home ”","headline":{"main":"Why

Ben Carson said on Sunday that he would not want to see a Muslim elected president  he did not just reignite a volatile conversation about the role of Islam in American life — he also exposed another fissure between many Republican leaders and elements of the party’s grass roots In the years since President George W  Bush sought to separate the Islamic extremists behind the Sept  11 attacks from the millions of practitioners of what he called a religion of peace  many in his party have come to reject the distinction It is hardly the only point of disagreement between Republican leaders who are determined to reorient the party to win in a changing country  and activists who are uneasy about what they see as threats to their way of life  But the debate over Islam is particularly worrisome for Republicans because it so vividly highlights the vacuum that has been created by the absence of a unifying leader who can temper the impulses of the rank and file “The conservative movement needs a pope ” said Matt Lewis  a conservative writer  “Whether it was William F  Buckley writing the Birchers out of the movement or George W  Bush using his voice and office to speak out about Islam  we need people who  like them  will take leadership positions ”But with many conservatives in the Obama years now seeing themselves as under siege  there are significant incentives for would be leaders to cater to what Mr  Lewis called “their sense of victimhood ”For Democrats  there is an opening to use the criticism of Islam to portray Republicans as intolerant  reinforcing an image that has damaged the party’s brand “I call on every Republican to denounce Dr  Carson’s disgusting remarks ” Senator Harry Reid  the Democratic leader  said on the Senate floor Monday  posting a photograph on Twitter of the star and crescent bedecked headstone of a Muslim American soldier who died in Iraq Muslim leaders also denounced Mr  Carson “My heart was so saddened to hear those words come out of the mouth of an individual who is seeking the highest office in our land ” said Mahdi Bray  an imam and director of the American Muslim Alliance  at a news conference in Washington  “Not only because it’s inconsistent with the United States Constitution  but what do I tell my kids?”While Muslims are viewed more skeptically by the American public than are members of any other faith  Republicans are especially uneasy about Islam  A Pew survey last year asking individuals to rate  from 1 to 100  their feelings about religious groups found that Muslims only averaged 33 percent among Republicans and Republican leaning voters — far below other faiths Evangelical Christians  in particular  are wary about Muslims  according to the research  Mr  Carson is an evangelical and has found appeal among this constituency in his presidential bid But concern about Islam extends more broadly on the right  Despite President Obama’s release of his birth certificate  false claims about his place of birth and faith persist among some conservatives  A full 60 percent of Republicans said they viewed Islam unfavorably in a 2013 New York Times CBS poll Those views were on display last week in New Hampshire when Donald J  Trump replied that he would be “looking at that” when a man attending a Trump town hall meeting called Mr  Obama a Muslim and said the country needs to “get rid of them ”Mr  Trump’s reaction was strikingly different from that of Senator John McCain  who  in the 2008 presidential campaign  was confronted by a similar voter  “He’s a decent family man  citizen  that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues ” Mr  McCain said to a woman who called Mr  Obama “an Arab ”It was also far removed from Mr  Bush’s response in the aftermath of the Sept  11 attacks  Fourteen years to the day before Mr  Carson’s comments on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press ” Mr  Bush  in an address to a joint session of Congress  drew a distinction between adherents of radical Islam and peaceful Muslims “The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics — a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam ” Mr  Bush said then He was  aides recall  concerned about the safety of American Muslims in the tumultuous days after the assault on New York and the Pentagon  But he also wanted to send a longer term message abroad that America intended to strike back only at jihadists Mr  Carson’s remark undermines that effort  former Bush aides said “What’s dangerous about what he said is that it sends the wrong message to the rest of the world ” said Tony Fratto  a former press secretary to Mr  Bush  “That somehow the actions we take for very legitimate national security reasons have anti Muslim roots  We’ve worked so hard to try to make it clear that that isn’t the case  But each time somebody does this kind of thing  it makes it harder ”Candidates vying to win support in a Republican primary are not much interested in such matters of diplomacy Republican strategists said that the videotaped beheadings by the Islamic State abroad  the jihadist attacks in world capitals like Paris and the mass shootings at Fort Hood  Tex   in 2009 and in Chattanooga  Tenn   this year had significant effects on views of Islam “It is harder for the idea that it is a religion of peace to take root when you’ve got multiple incidents at home and abroad and it’s not just Osama bin Laden ” said Glen Bolger  a Republican pollster There is also frustration among many Republicans over Mr  Obama’s refusal to refer directly to “radical Islamic terrorism ” something that has created more pressure on G O P  candidates to talk bluntly about the matter Henry Olsen  a scholar at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center  said it would be enough for many Republicans if the party’s candidates asserted that America’s adversaries were inspired by radical Islam But  Mr  Olsen said  it was incumbent on party leaders to recognize the difference between jihadists and the Muslim population at large in the same way that  during the Cold War  Americans differentiated between the country’s social democratic allies and communists  But such distinctions can be easily lost  or intentionally blurred  when conservatives do not have a leader and candidates like Mr  Trump and Mr  Carson see an opportunity to channel voters’ anxieties “Having a leaderless party makes it more likely that those voices that were always there can arise ” Mr  Fratto said And in an era of diminished political parties and fragmented news media  voices of authority can be easily outmatched by those of provocation  “Anybody can have a megaphone now ” Mr  Lewis said  “But only a few people have clout ”He added  “And when you don’t have a clear leader  that’s when warlords can arise ”","headline":{"main":"Without Calming Voice, G.O.P.

How would one of the largest cities in one of the country’s most conservative states respond to a candidate whose bombast and brashness can sometimes seem limitless? Would Mr  Trump wear a “Make America Great Again” baseball hat  perhaps to conceal the effects of the wilting Gulf Coast heat and humidity on his much remarked upon mane?As usual  the answers — no  loudly and yes — came amid the trademark gusto of both Mr  Trump’s personality and his evolving campaign for the presidency “Now I know how the great Billy Graham felt  because this is the same feeling ” Mr  Trump  referring to the celebrated evangelist  thundered from a stage built for the night’s rally  where the vast stretches of empty seats indicated that attendance had fallen short of the more than 30 000 people he had predicted Mr  Trump’s errant forecast appeared to do little to diminish the zeal of those who did gather for an event that occasionally sounded more like a concert — there was a playlist that included Elton John’s “Rocket Man ” as well as a five man band — than a political rally  But the night was punctuated with plenty of forceful reminders  including roaring chants of “U S A   U S A  ” that Mobile had become an unexpected stop on the presidential campaign trail “Please focus your attention to the eastern sky ” a man’s voice announced on the loudspeakers at one point  “for the arrival in Mobile  Ala   of the next president of the United States  Donald J  Trump ” As advertised  Mr  Trump’s jet soon passed over the stadium By the time of the flyover  some Trump fans had been at the stadium for about 12 hours  attracted to an event whose potential for scale and boisterousness surged as the week went on  Mr  Trump’s campaign at first intended to hold the rally at a far smaller site  But as word spread that he would bring his red  white and blue road show to Mobile — an easy drive from New Orleans  Birmingham  Ala   and Jackson  Miss  — his aides said that interest was outpacing their plans And so Mr  Trump turned to one of the state’s largest venues for a rally of such a profile that Mobile’s mayor issued a news release filled with details about parking  shuttles and the weather  Before the gate opened at 5 p m   two hours before Mr  Trump’s scheduled appearance  hundreds of people stood in a line snaking well into a parking lot That did not startle many of Mr  Trump’s supporters “I’m not surprised at all ” said Tommy Hopper  51  a petroleum cargo surveyor who lives near Mobile  “When Alabama people believe in something  Alabama people go full force  We’re not a halfway state  it’s all or nothing ”As night fell and he entered to the sounds of “Sweet Home Alabama ” Mr  Trump displayed similar vigor  He needled Jeb Bush  the former Florida governor  and critiqued Hillary Rodham Clinton  He denounced “politicians who don’t have a clue” and talked again of building a wall to seal the border with Mexico  a popular stand in a place that pursued an aggressive state level effort to curb illegal immigration  And he told the crowd that he preferred the Bible to one of his own books “As much as I love ‘The Art of the Deal ’ it’s not even close ” Mr  Trump said  “We take the Bible all the way ”What remains to be seen is whether Mr  Trump will be able to sustain Friday’s clamor in Alabama  which will hold its primary on March 1  Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania won the Republican primary here in 2012 and is again seeking the presidency  but many people here said they were reluctant to support a more traditional politician Although Mr  Trump has drawn criticism for unveiling few detailed policy proposals  many of his supporters said they were unbothered “When he gets in there  he’ll figure it out ” said Amanda Mancini  who said she had traveled from California to see Mr  Trump  “So we do have to trust him  but he has something that we can trust in  We can look at the Trump brand  we can look at what he’s done  and we can say that’s how he’s done everything ”Still  others said they had plenty of advice for the man they regularly identified in conversation as “Mr  Trump ”“Hopefully  he’s going to sit there and say  ‘When I become elected president  what we’re going to do is we’re going to make the border a vacation spot  it’s going to cost you  25 for a permit  and then you get  50 for every confirmed kill ’ ” said Jim Sherota  53  who works for a landscaping company  “That’d be one nice thing ”Mr  Trump did not offer such a proposal  But under a threatening sky and in between cutting comments  he did crack wise about his hair “Who cares if it rains  right?” he asked  “If it rains  I’ll take off my hat  and I’ll prove once and for all that it’s mine ”","headline":{"main":"Donald Trump Fails to Fill Alabama Stadium, but Fans’ Zeal Is Undiminished","print_headline":"Trump Fails to Fill Alabama Stadium, but Fans&#8217; Zeal Is Hardly Diminished"},"wordCount":"892"},

by the Hampton Synagogue here on Saturday  he was expected to offer a critique of the Iran deal and a short version of his stump speech to the Orthodox congregation But something else was on his mind  the insults hurled at him by Donald J  Trump “I’ll just give you a little taste of the ‘low energy’ candidate’s life this week ” Mr  Bush said  referring to the stinging taunt Mr  Trump has repeatedly used to describe him Mr  Bush then spent a minute and a half reeling off the cities he had visited since Monday — among them McAllen  Tex   Salt Lake City  Denver  Pensacola  Fla   Birmingham  Ala   Greensboro  N C  — and noted that  earlier in the week  he had risen at 6 a m  to go running with former members of the Navy SEALs near the Virginia coast “The ‘low energy’ candidate this week has only been six days  16 hours a day campaigning with joy in my heart ” he said But Mr  Bush does not seem to be radiating much joy these days He said last year that he would run for president only if he could do so with a sunny spirit  but Mr  Trump  the surprise leader in the polls  has turned this summer into a miserable one for Mr  Bush  gleefully ignoring the traditional rules of political engagement There is the personal ridicule — continually questioning Mr  Bush’s vigor  invoking a since retracted statement by his mother  Barbara Bush  that “we’ve had enough Bushes” in the White House  and on Wednesday suggesting that Mr  Bush should stop speaking Spanish But the torment goes deeper than that  Emphasizing bluster over ideas  Mr  Trump has turned the campaign into a tabloid style clash of personalities  heavy on provocation and insults  What little policy that has been discussed mostly revolves around Mr  Trump’s appeals to anxious white conservatives  stoking fears about immigrants  gang members and foreign countries that  in his telling  are eclipsing the United States It is a race  in other words  that embodies what Mr  Bush likes least about politics Mr  Bush is at his most animated discussing policy  And the only thing he may be more passionate about than issues is his conviction that the Republicans must become an inclusive  big hearted party that appeals to people’s hopes rather than their resentments “It’s got to be difficult ” said John McKager Stipanovich  a veteran Florida lobbyist who has known Mr  Bush for more than 30 years  “Donald Trump epitomizes everything that Jeb has spent his political career trying to prevent the Republican Party from becoming ”Mr  Bush and his aides insist that they are not bothered by Mr  Trump and how he has upended the race  But moments of irritation keep spilling out in public “Just to state the obvious  Can’t wait for this summer reality TV show to be over ” Mr  Bush’s son Jeb Jr  said on Twitter on Tuesday  alongside a link to a new video his father released attacking Mr  Trump That same day  his father  after a campaign event in Miami  seemed irked when reporters asked him about Mr  Trump “He attacks me every day with nonsense  with things that aren’t true ” Mr  Bush said in Spanish  before saying much the same in English  “He tries to personalize everything  If you are not totally in agreement with him  you’re an idiot  or stupid  or you have no energy  or blah  blah  blah  That’s what he does ”When a reporter proposed asking “a non Trump question  if you don’t mind ” Mr  Bush replied  “I’d love it ”More than annoyance is at stake  Mr  Bush’s advisers say they believe that the relentless mockery by Mr  Trump is contributing to their candidate’s slide in the polls  In a new Des Moines Register Bloomberg Politics poll  more Iowa Republicans view Mr  Bush unfavorably than favorably  Mr  Bush has also slipped in some national surveys  falling into single digits and well back in the Republican pack The campaign does not want donors and up for grab Republican voters to see Mr  Bush as meekly absorbing Mr  Trump’s blows  so Mr  Bush  a former Florida governor  has begun to criticize Mr  Trump aggressively on the campaign trail  This week  he released a video highlighting the developer’s previous liberal views Still  seemingly powerless to pull Mr  Trump down  Mr  Bush and his advisers are expressing anger over what they see as the news media’s enabling of Mr  Trump by not scrutinizing his far fetched plans  such as making Mexico pay for a wall along the United States’ southern border “Look  this guy’s the front runner ” Mr  Bush said last week at a town hall style meeting in Norfolk  Va  “He should be treated like a front runner  not like some kind

Mr  Bush said with a touch of wonder that Mr  Trump’s rise reminded him of reality TV  adding that he was the only candidate taking him on and that he hoped the news media would begin aggressively vetting Mr  Trump  according to an attendee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about a private event Mr  Bush’s aides have recently asked reporters why they will not say outright that Mr  Trump’s ideas on  to name two issues  mass deportations and trade tariffs  are fantasy “Our country faces serious challenges — we need a serious candidate who has real solutions ” said Sally Bradshaw  Mr  Bush’s strategist and closest adviser Mr  Bush’s backers note that the campaign has yet to broadcast any TV ads and that their candidate’s standing in the polls is likely to look different after they highlight Mr  Bush’s conservative record as Florida governor on the air As Mr  Bush himself said Tuesday  “The election is not tomorrow ”Of course  Mr  Trump’s strength could ultimately be a political gift to Mr  Bush  If the real estate mogul remains atop the polls heading into next year and denies attention to other hard line candidates  Republicans could flock to support Mr  Bush  the safe  well credentialed and well funded son and brother of presidents  to stop Mr  Trump But any long term optimism is tempered by recognition that the race has become a grind  and that Mr  Trump has for now made the campaign about himself  his appeal and how far he can go “He has faith over time in the people and the power of his ideas ” said Mike Murphy  Mr  Bush’s longtime adviser and the head of his “super PAC ” “But he has to exist for a while in a world where every news clip is horse race” reporting On Saturday  after remaining with the congregation for a singing of the hymn “Adon Olam ” set to the tune of “God Bless America ” Mr  Bush walked out of the synagogue toward his waiting sport utility vehicle  He was asked by a reporter if he was frustrated with Mr  Trump  Mr  Bush shot back  “I don’t think I mentioned his name ”But he did not leave it there  After climbing into the passenger seat and closing the door  Mr  Bush lowered the window and  as the vehicle edged out of the parking lot  three more times demanded  “Did I mention his name?”","headline":{"main":"A Once-Sunny Jeb Bush, Bristling in the Long Shadow of Donald

Senator Ted Cruz of Texas continues his Southern bus tour  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont catches Hillary Rodham Clinton in New Hampshire  and soapbox stump speeches and the smells of fried foods and natural fertilizers await the candidates in Iowa Charlie Szold  the communications director for the Republican Party of Iowa  sent an email on Wednesday  saying that “97 percent of Iowa corn has reached the ‘silking stage ’ ” And that can mean only one thing  It’s State Fair time The 11 day Iowa State Fair beginning on Thursday in Des Moines is Iowa’s biggest event of the year  Its one million visitors come to ogle a life size cow sculpted from butter  visit the livestock barns  and snack on fried Oreos and pork chops on a stick But the fair is also a political cornucopia  Nearly every candidate from both parties is planning a visit  braving the scorching weather to coax a few more voters in the first in the nation nominating state  Most candidates will speak for 20 minutes on the Soapbox  a stage that has hay bale seating and is sponsored by The Des Moines Register  It is a rare occasion to address a bipartisan crowd and has elicited memorable moments over the years  It was here that Mitt Romney told a heckler in 2011 that “corporations are people  my friend ” a line that followed him through the general election Mike Huckabee is first on the schedule on Thursday morning  followed by the Democrats Jim Webb  the former Virginia senator  and Martin O’Malley  the former Maryland governor Jeb Bush will appear on Friday  with most of the rest of the candidates appearing over the weekend and into next week Mrs  Clinton is visiting the fair on Saturday  but will not speak publicly on the Soapbox  Donald J  Trump  whose offer of children’s rides in his helicopter was nixed by fair officials  was said to be heading to the fair on Saturday as well  though at the time of publication  the details were sketchy  His campaign told The Des Moines Register that Mr  Trump would not  as earlier reported  be introducing Def Leppard on the Grandstand stage  Footnote  Where would creaking metal bands be without state fairs? — Trip GabrielStay tuned

his schedule there on Wednesday night with a Pints and Politics event  starts his day with a Coffee and Conversation town hall style meeting  before heading to a pork roast in Henry County Mr  Bush will attend the Polk County 2015 Summer Sizzle  a gathering “for family fun  classic cars and great food ”And Carly Fiorina  who has emerged as a Republican weapon against charges that the party is engaged in a war on women  will hold a town hall style event In New Hampshire  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ben Carson have the place to themselves Maybe it’s because a new poll in New Hampshire has Mr  Sanders tied with Mrs  Clinton among likely Democratic primary voters Or maybe it’s because the attention paid to Mrs  Clinton’s sweeping plan to make college more affordable was eclipsed by headlines like  “The email story just keeps getting worse for Hillary Clinton ”Whatever the reason  the Clinton campaign has chosen the August doldrums to go on offense after months of coverage about her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state On Tuesday  after the campaign said Mrs  Clinton had directed aides to give the Justice Department the server and a thumb drive that contained copies of the emails  her advisers convened a late night conference call to get surrogates on message  “Hillary Clinton’s use of personal email was consistent with the practice of prior secretaries of state and permitted at the time she was secretary of state ” read a crucial talking point  Then  on Wednesday  Jennifer Palmieri  a spokeswoman for the campaign  emailed supporters  “A note about Hillary Clinton’s emails” that tried to explain the latest development “Many of the Republican candidates for president have done the same things for which they’re now criticizing Hillary ” Ms  Palmieri wrote Mr  Sanders was not mentioned — Amy ChozickThough Mr  Sanders is engaged in a tight race with Mrs  Clinton in New Hampshire  according to recent polls  it is hard to say who is winning The most recent poll  from Franklin Pierce University and the Boston Herald  showed Mr  Sanders with the support of 44 percent of likely Democratic voters and Mrs  Clinton at 37 percent  The poll of 442 people claimed to have a margin of error of 4 7 percentage points  which The New York Times  as per policy  rounded to five While many headlines blared that Mr  Sanders had overtaken Mrs  Clinton in New Hampshire  The Times confused some readers by reporting this as a “statistical tie ” Why  many asked  was Mr  Sanders not winning if he was up by number greater than the margin of error?As The Times’s polling team notes  the difference between Mr  Sanders and Mrs  Clinton is not statistically significant  despite what the headline numbers might to suggest “A poll’s aim is to try to figure out what a certain population thinks by interviewing a small sample of that group and weighting the results ” said Megan Thee Brenan  deputy editor of news surveys at The Times  “But even with good weighting  there is error built into the process “The fastest way to roughly determine whether the difference between two candidates is statistically significant is to double the margin of sampling error — in this case five — and compare that number with the difference between the two percentages  For Mr  Sanders or Mrs  Clinton to be “winning” in this poll  one of them would have to be up by roughly more than 10 points — Alan RappeportThe passions of big contributors — and their ability to change a candidate’s fortunes — are a keenly felt undercurrent to the debate over the fate of President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran A word catches fire on social media among disaffected Republicans  called racist by some  who feel their candidates lean too far left During a campaign trip to New Hampshire  Gov  John R  Kasich of Ohio said that conservatives should not be shy about saying that “we care about people who are down and out  and we want to give them a chance to succeed ”And former President Jimmy Carter said that recent liver surgery revealed cancer that had spread to several parts of his body  A group that includes the great great grandson of Charles Darwin and 28 Nobel laureates  Newsweek writes  has been pressing for presidential candidates to hold a science only debate  under the thinking that many of the most important issues on the trail “are impossible to discuss without dealing with physics  math and biology ” In 2008  they were ignored  But  this year  they “believe they have a better chance ”“If Donald Trump were to ask me to be his running mate ” Jesse Ventura  a former professional wrestler  movie star and governor of Minnesota told a local CBS station  “I would give it very serious consideration ”And The Huffington Post profiles a key campaign staff member on Mr  O’Malley’s team  his teenage son Both the Democratic and Republican parties are seeing the rise of outsider candidates like Mr  Sanders  Mr  Carson and Mr  Trump as they campaign against the established political status quo  The Washington Post reports Politico looks at how Huma Abedin  Mrs  Clinton‘s most trusted aide  is becoming increasingly embroiled in her boss’s email scandal Mr  Cruz reached behind the black leather seat for his briefcase “The bus tour doesn’t let me read  I read on airplanes ” he said  “This bus tour is terrible for that ”As he has zigzagged across the country  often cramming in three or four events a day with hours of travel between  he’s working between too  signing books  doing interviews and playing with his two children But  he still came prepared  and offered First Draft a look at his current reading list The two books in his briefcase were from prominent conservative voices  “The Conservative Heart ” by Arthur Brooks  president of the American Enterprise Institute  which Mr  Cruz said he was in the middle of and enjoying greatly  and “Plunder and Deceit ” by Mark R  Levin  the nationally syndicated conservative radio host But Mr  Cruz heaped the most praise on two books he had recently finished  The first was  “Reckless Endangerment ” by Gretchen Morgenson  a Times reporter  and Joshua Rosner  about the financial crisis  “A great book ” Mr  Cruz said But his favorite? “The Looming Tower ” by Lawrence Wright “It’s just gripping ” Mr  Cruz said  “highly recommending” the book to First Draft  “It traces back to the 1950s and the rise of radical Islam  and it goes through it just with a level of detail ”“And it’s well written ” he added  “It’s a great read ”— Nick Corasaniti","headline":{"main":"Today

of recovery for many of the candidates who were perhaps required by custom and duty to cheat on their diets at the Iowa State Fair this weekend  While most of the candidates move on to a full week  others were busy outside the fair’s lively lights  seeking money rather than votes on a high end and tourist filled Massachusetts island To glance at the news  most readers would surely think the State Fair in Des Moines was the center of the political universe  After all  it is where Jeb Bush mixed a pre noon beer with a deep fried Snickers  where Hillary Rodham Clinton munched a pork chop on a stick and where Donald J  Trump landed his helicopter But if you happened to be spending a few days this month on Nantucket  and to have a few thousand dollars to spare  you could see nearly as many candidates Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was there on Friday  Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mrs  Clinton were there on Sunday  while Mr  Bush is coming to the island off Cape Cod in Massachusetts on Thursday  None are fishing for voters — and certainly not news media attention They were lured  like many politicians  by the wealthy summer residents and visitors thronging the island’s fund raisers The dueling destinations not only represent two very different slices of Americana  they also illuminate what are effectively parallel presidential campaigns  There is the one

Nick CorasanitiThe newest poll and post debate report card from Fox News shows some of the Republican Party’s biggest names languishing amid signs of life from upstart candidates and Mr  Trump‘s continued dominance Fox’s new poll showed that despite Mr  Trump’s warring with the network  he remained the favorite of 25 percent of likely Republican primary voters  virtually unchanged from just before the debate  Showing the biggest gains from Fox’s previous poll were Ben Carson  at 12 percent  and Mr  Cruz  at 10 Mr  Bush and Mr  Rubio  who many saw as early favorites  showed signs of weakness  Mr  Bush’s support dropped to 9 percent from 15 percent in early August  after what many analysts considered to be a lackluster debate performance  Mr  Rubio  who got strong marks at the debate  was in a cluster of third tier candidates  including Gov  John Kasich of Ohio  at 4 percent Mr  Rubio and Mr  Bush  the former governor of Florida  were the most popular second choice candidates  however  suggesting that if Mr  Trump’s campaign unravels  they could regain their front runner status While the Democrats have not had their first debate  Mr  Sanders continues to make gains on Mrs  Clinton  His support among likely Democratic voters rose to 30 percent from 22 percent in two weeks  while backing for Mrs  Clinton is at 49 percent  essentially unchanged from 51

I would rather think better of you Fiorina is running as the anti Hillary   “I think if Hillary Clinton faces a woman opponent  she will get a hitch in her swing ”  She is the kind of person who tells you that when she went to college she studied philosophy  ancient Greek  Latin  French and German  then adds that she also took Italian  “But that was just for the fun of it ”That last bit comes from her memoir  which chronicles her rise to head of Hewlett Packard in 1999  followed by a rather inglorious firing in 2005 for reasons that she most definitely feels were not her fault In her first campaign video  she’s shown watching Clinton’s announcement  We now have videos of candidates attacking other candidates’ videos  Soon we will drop debates entirely in favor of tweet offs “Our founders never intended us to have a professional political class ” Fiorina says  turning to the camera Virtually every elected president in American history — not counting the occasional military hero — made his way to the top by getting elected to other offices first  There are a couple of exceptions who just served in the cabinet  like Herbert Hoover  We can all look forward to hearing a candidate vow to return us to the golden days of the Hoover administration Fiorina’s answer is to go back to men like Thomas Jefferson  state legislator  governor  diplomat  secretary of state  vice president   who she says believed strictly in “citizen government ” The founders may not have liked the idea of a political class  but they picked presidents who were part of one  Public men  whose experience in private enterprise frequently involved running a plantation into the ground Fiorina  whose tenure at Hewlett Packard included a controversial merger deal and the layoff of about 30 000 employees  is actually an excellent example of why we don’t want the country to be run like a business  The American people aren’t just shareholders  They would like their government to be efficient  and they would like the budget to balance  But they also want a lot of other stuff — protection from evildoers  compassion for the needy  assistance in retirement  highways without potholes  good schools  a healthy environment Who gets what first is a political question  One that preferably would be resolved without having any internal crises so exciting that the chief executive gets tossed out of office People who run for president boasting that they aren’t politicians are frequently just trying to compensate for a lack of political skill  Carson  who presumably wants to run government like an operating room  is going to appeal to the folks who think the military is plotting to take over Texas  but otherwise  his only political gift seems to be for making outrageous statements  Fiorina ran for the Senate in 2010 and was beaten by Barbara Boxer  who was thought to be a vulnerable incumbent until Fiorina got hold of her  racking up a grand total of 42 percent of the vote On the plus side  Fiorina’s campaign produced one of the all time great attack videos  in which her more moderate primary opponent was depicted as a Demon Sheep  portrayed by a man crawling across the grass with what looked like a wooly rug over his back and a piece of cardboard on his face  After that it was downhill all the way If you’re shopping for candidates with no experience in the business they want to lead  I’d say at least go for the one with the Demon  But really  there are smarter buys ","headline":{"main":"Beyond the Demon Sheep","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"Beyond the Demon Sheep"},"wordCount":"823"},

rockfish and crab lunch for a visiting Vietnamese leader  Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  seemed subdued as he talked of a painful history and a promising future between the United States and Vietnam  He ad libbed some remarks  made a few mild jokes and stared straight ahead when his guest spoke Six weeks after the death of his elder son  Mr  Biden has thrown himself back into his work  meeting with foreign leaders  giving speeches and even cheering on the women’s national soccer team in its victory over Japan in the World Cup  Unsurprisingly  in the shadow of tragedy  he is not his typically ebullient self  But by all accounts he is feeling his way forward and trying to figure out what comes next Even without the heartbreak of loss  this was bound to be a crossroads moment for a vice president who has spent four decades in Washington only to find an uncertain path ahead  He has not ruled out running for president again  and some friends are nudging him to  even if the political math does not seem to favor it  But he has good days and bad days  his mind never far from his late son  Beau Biden  and his staff is not planning further than two weeks ahead “This is not a guy who is going to go easily ” said former Senator Ted Kaufman  a longtime confidant appointed to fill Mr  Biden’s seat representing Delaware in the Senate after the 2008 election elevated him to the vice presidency  “Whatever he’s doing  he’s going to stay involved  He’s not looking to retire  like me  He’s pretty clearly in the ‘I’m going to do everything I can to use what I’ve learned to be involved ’ ”Whether that means another campaign remains unclear  Mr  Biden  72  has 18 months left in his current job  and advisers said he felt a duty to its responsibilities  It has also been therapeutic to get back to the White House and focus on issues like clean energy and foreign policy  Among his assignments are the dicey challenges of Ukraine and Iraq  And just over the horizon is another potential budget battle The work helps  say friends  advisers and White House officials  And recent White House victories have not hurt  For Mr  Biden  the Supreme Court ruling on same sex marriage proved sweet vindication  one he celebrated Thursday at an event in New York sponsored by the advocacy group Freedom to Marry While gay rights activists credit him for speaking out for same sex marriage before President Obama did  Mr  Biden’s most pivotal role came in 1987 when  as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  he led the fight to block confirmation of Robert H  Bork  the conservative jurist  to the Supreme Court  Eventually confirmed to that seat instead was Justice Anthony M  Kennedy  the swing vote who wrote the court’s 5 to 4 marriage decision The New York event was just part of a busy schedule assembled for Mr  Biden  Since returning to work  he has met with the prime minister of Ukraine  the speaker of the Iraqi Parliament  the president of Brazil  the president of Honduras  the prime minister of Canada and the prime minister of Mongolia  while also making calls to other world leaders  On Monday  he will participate in the United States Ukraine Business Forum and later give a speech on India at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Mr  Biden is not ready to talk about the future and did not respond to a request for an interview  But he is seen in a different light for the moment  Wherever he goes these days  he receives condolences  Indeed  Mr  Biden’s grief has been so public  so human  in a way not seen in a sitting president or vice president in many years  that it has  struck a nerve in Washington and beyond Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  a Republican presidential candidate  choked up while talking to a video crew from the Huffington Post about Mr  Biden  “I called him after Beau died  and he basically said  ‘Well  Beau was my soul ’ ” Mr  Graham said with tears in his eyes When Mr  Graham retired from the Air Force Reserve  he noted  Mr  Biden made a point of attending the ceremony  “He’s the nicest person I think I’ve ever met in politics ” Mr  Graham said  “He is as good a man as God ever created  And we don’t agree on much  but I think he’s been dealt a really gut blow ”Many already knew Mr  Biden’s history of gut blows  especially the death of his wife and year old daughter in a car accident weeks after his first election to the Senate in 1972  But with the death of Beau from brain cancer at 46  they saw someone struggling again to bear the unbearable  this time on an even bigger public stage As his son’s body lay in honor in Legislative Hall in Dover  Del   Mr  Biden stood for five hours straight greeting visitors  At the public viewing in Wilmington the next day  he stood receiving mourners for 10 hours without a break  “His ability to provide comfort to others at a time of his own tragedy is unlike anybody I’ve ever seen ” said Gov  Jack Markell of Delaware Mark Gitenstein  a longtime aide and friend  said the vice president had become “America’s father” as people watched him cope with grace and humanity  “One of the most touching and reaffirming silver linings in this awful period has been the rest of America has seen the Joe Biden that I’ve seen for over 30 years ” he said Beau’s death made the tragedy public  but the vice president had been quietly dealing with his son’s losing battle with cancer for months  Mr  Biden went ahead with speeches and meetings while spending as much time as he could at his dying son’s side Now he brings up Beau regularly  In a foreign policy talk at the Truman National Security Project  a group that includes many war veterans  he praised its members for being engaged for the right reasons “like my son Beau was ” and talked movingly about those lost in combat “It was not a dry  bloodless policy speech ” said Michael Breen  the project’s executive director  “He didn’t show up and go on autopilot  He talked in very emotional terms about all the people we’ve lost in Iraq and Afghanistan ”Mr  Biden accompanied Mr  Obama to Charleston  S C   for the funeral of the Rev  Clementa C  Pinckney  one of nine black churchgoers killed by a white gunman at Emanuel A M E  Church  Afterward  Mr  Biden headed with Beau’s family to nearby Kiawah Island  where they had already planned to spend a weekend Sitting in a vacation house the next day  the vice president told relatives that he was thinking about going back to the church on Sunday  He felt a need to be with others who were grieving  “To be selfish about it  the reason we came was to draw some strength from all of you ” he told the congregation when he arrived Rosary beads on his wrist  Mr  Biden said he wished he could ease their pain  “But I know from experience  and I was reminded of it again  29 days ago  that no words can mend a broken heart ” he said  “No music can fill a gaping void  At least in my experience  only faith  and sometimes  as all the preachers here would know  sometimes even faith leaves you just for a second  Sometimes you doubt ”He has spent much of these last weeks with his family  especially Beau’s children  Natalie  10  and Hunter  9  He took them to Vancouver for the soccer championship  He doted on Hunter  holding his hand firmly in his  leaning over and explaining the action on the field  When the clock expired and the Americans had won  the vice president turned to Hunter for a high five When Michael A  Memoli of The Los Angeles Times asked Mr  Biden if he had played soccer as a child  Mr  Biden’s thoughts turned again to his late son  “Beau played and was captain of the soccer team ” he recalled  “And I never played soccer  But I watched all Beau’s games ”Since long before he died  Beau Biden was among those encouraging his father to think about running in 2016  Some backers have researched early primary states  but aides said discussions of a race are less intense now than they were last spring  The vice president has not authorized preparations  and aides have scratched their heads at supporters quoted in news accounts suggesting he is poised to run If anything  they said  Mr  Biden has not been able to focus that far ahead  He has always been tempted and is keeping his options open  but any decision is weeks if not months away while he focuses on family  “It’s not like he has all this time now to think about his future ” one adviser said  “He has to process everything ”","headline":{"main":"Grieving Joe Biden Focuses on the Job He Has Now, Not the Next

Presumably the comedic tone might have seemed a little jarring Mr  Schur said that while they did not shoot the scene in two entirely different ways  they did give Ms  Poehler one more line to make as a glancing reference to an unhappy outcome  to have on hand just in case  “It was a very  very slight adjustment ” Mr  Schur said One that the show’s producers were only too happy not to need to make — although probably not nearly as happy as Mr  Biden ","headline":{"seo":"Joe Biden to Appear on ‘Parks and Recreation’","main":"No Method Acting: On Sitcom, Biden Plays Biden","print_headline":"No Method Acting: On Sitcom, Biden Plays Biden"},"wordCount":"741"},

when he announced he was running for president  “I’m not using the lobbyists  I’m not using donors ” And of course  he added  “I’m really rich ”This self financing has been one of the factors helping propel him to the top of the polls  many Republican voters have said they value his independent  candid style  But Mr  Trump may be changing his tune on self financing  a switch that could provide the toughest test of his popularity to date His campaign added a “contributions” page to the campaign website  He recently attended a fund raiser held by a super PAC supporting his bid  He told CBS’s John Dickerson that he actually likes the idea of people “investing in a campaign” as long as no strings are attached  And on Friday  Mr  Trump held a  100 per person fund raiser  He insisted it was not a fund raiser because the money raised didn’t exceed the cost of the event  He said he wasn’t going to do this kind of event again He has also said he has accepted small donations so as not to insult the people who have sent them All of this maneuvering about fund raising  however  is about more than just money Opening up his campaign to donations might provide exactly the opportunity he needs to demonstrate his campaign is organized  professional and efficient — and has broad support among the electorate and elite donors  If he can do that  party leaders may take notice A candidate’s ability to raise money is important for other reasons that are important to winning elections  People don’t just hand over money to political candidates  They have to be asked  And that asking requires a campaign organization focused on finding  communicating with and cultivating supporters — whether those supporters are financial bundlers  other politicians or rank and file voters How much money and where it comes from can also signal how broad the candidate’s support is within the party — and how deep  Mr  Trump often reminds people that he is leading in the polls  But as analysts often remind him  it is very early  Polls at this stage don’t reliably signal who eventually wins the nomination  Other more solid indicators at this stage include elite endorsements and a capacity to raise money If you doubt the validity of raising money as a signal about a candidate’s appeal to elites and voters  consider other self financed candidates like Steve Forbes or Meg Whitman  who spent millions of their own money and lost elections Perhaps the best example  however  comes from comparing the Mitt Romney of 2008 with the Mitt Romney of 2012  In 2008  42 percent of Mr  Romney’s campaign war chest came from his own bank account  He raised only  60 million from individual donors and lost the nomination  In 2012  he raised roughly four times the total amount of money he did in the previous cycle  and 99 percent of it came from individual donors  He increased his yield from individual donors sixfold Moreover  at the end of 2011  Mr  Romney led the Republican field across four indicators of early support  despite the fact that many other candidates had been ahead in the polls in 2011  He led in endorsements  news coverage and tone  fund raising  and average share of polls Mr  Trump currently leads in two of these  news and polls   He has yet to garner an endorsement from a sitting Republican governor  senator or House member  And he took direct fund raising off the table Entering the race for that kind of money  however  would not be easy  Mr  Trump currently ranks 14th among the Republican field in total money raised  including money raised by super PACs and other outside groups allied with the campaign  He has reported  1 9 million in receipts to the Federal Election Commission  all but about  100 000 from his own bank account  The campaign says the  100 000 is from small donors who sent money without being asked   Jeb Bush leads the G O P  field with a total of about  120 million in the bank  Mr  Trump may continue to eschew money from lobbyists and special interests and condemn those candidates who take it  but a closer look at the F E C  fund raising numbers reveals an interesting pattern that underscores the importance of campaign organization in soliciting donations  Candidates who are good at raising money from super PACs are also good at raising money from individual donors  And vice versa Mr  Bush  Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have all raised a lot of money from super PACs and outside groups  but they are also the top three candidates in terms of campaign contributions by individual donors  Dismissing candidates who raise unlimited sums of money from outside groups as being indebted to those interests and therefore untrustworthy ignores the fact that those candidates are also the ones raising the most money from more limited individual contributions The explanation for this pattern may in part come from the candidate’s appeal among the electorate and within the party  But another important part is the professionalism of their organizations and their ability to find and ask the right people to contribute across a range of possibilities Mr  Trump’s decision to solicit and take small contributions may demonstrate that voters like him enough to put their money behind him  But it might also reveal things about him as a candidate and his campaign’s competence that we have not learned from the polls  Although voters may be drawn to a candidate who chooses to self finance his campaign  few voters are likely to be impressed by one who has to ","headline":{"main":"Why Fund-Raising Is Important, Even if You Are

presence of the pope  I assumed that we were seeing the tears of a proud Catholic On Friday  when he announced that he’d be resigning as the speaker of the House of Representatives and leaving Congress at the end of next month  I revised that view I think he was crying  at least in part  for the ill fortunes and uncertain future of his pathologically self destructive party  It’s something that should have all of us sobbing Boehner’s looming departure and the rabid right wing forces that led to it are part of a longer story  developing for years now  His exodus was foreshadowed and even foreordained by the political demise of Eric Cantor  who served under him as the House majority leader until someone more conservative toppled him in a Republican primary in 2014 One of our two major political parties is hostage to an extreme subgroup that won’t brook compromise  values theatrical protests over actual governing and is adolescent in its ideological vanity Of course Boehner couldn’t last  He’s an adult  And as Donald Trump’s perverse currency and a Republican nominating contest that’s often indistinguishable from a temper tantrum demonstrate  the qualities of maturity  steadiness and prudence aren’t in especially big favor right now with an animated  engaged and frighteningly influential segment of the Republican electorate I’m not saying that the Republican Party alone has wing nuts  disrupters  brats  Too often that’s the impression left by journalists ruing the G O P ’s unruly ways But Democrats over recent years haven’t been bedeviled by internal dissent and rendered dysfunctional to the extent that Republicans have  They’ve kept something of a lid on things and maintained a semblance of order Not so with Republicans  who have become the party of brinkmanship  the party of imminent credit defaults  the party of threatened shutdowns  the party that won’t pass a proper transportation bill  the party that is suddenly demonizing the Export Import Bank  the party of “no ” the party of ire  the party that casts even someone as unquestionably conservative as John Boehner in the role of apostate  simply because he knows the difference between fights that can be won and those that can’t  between standing on principle and shooting yourself in the foot “He’s somebody who understands that in government — in governance — you don’t get 100 percent of what you want ” President Obama said on Friday at the White House  reflecting on the fresh news that Boehner was leaving  “But you have to work with people who you disagree with  sometimes strongly  in order to do the people’s business ” Obama and Boehner were hardly a study in “Kumbaya” cooperation  but Obama seemed to sense that the song sung by whoever follows Boehner will be sourer and more strident Brace for it What an odd end to an extraordinary week  and not just because the pope addressed Congress — a history making first — and pleaded for a spirit of collaboration  common purpose and amity  only for Boehner’s announcement to underscore how fugitive and far away that spirit remains It was unusual  too  because if the Republicans hadn’t been imploding  the conversation might well have been about the Democrats’ woes  or rather Hillary Clinton’s problems On Thursday  a national poll showed Clinton losing to Carly Fiorina  Ben Carson and Jeb Bush — but not to Donald Trump — in hypothetical matchups  A New Hampshire poll gave Bernie Sanders a sizable lead over Clinton in that state And with reports that the F B I  was successfully retrieving emails that had supposedly been wiped from her private server  it became clearer than ever that this particular chapter isn’t close to over  It seems almost inevitable that a few of these emails will contradict statements Clinton has made about what was and wasn’t erased and why  I don’t see her “honest and trustworthy” numbers rising anytime soon The Republican Party should have a fantastic shot in 2016 not just at the White House but at total control  because they’ll easily keep their gerrymandered House majority and can hope to preserve their advantage in the Senate  It would be their dream come true But the party’s most bellicose politicians and most cantankerous voters are doing their puerile best to dash it  The chasm between them and the party’s calmer types endures  and becomes starker  foiling the best laid plans of the sober minded realists REPUBLICANS were supposed to streamline their nominating process  but they have 15 candidates  and that’s down from 17 a month ago  Republicans were supposed to adopt a friendlier face to immigrants and a warmer embrace of diversity  but immigrant bashing and fear of Muslims have been dominant themes of the primary contest so far Republicans were supposed to show themselves to be grown ups  but the current leader of the pack  Trump  does a dead on impersonation of a defensive  insecure schoolyard bully And he warps the whole field of candidates  drawing others into ludicrous spats  yanking them toward stances they might not take so easily  turning the spectacle into a farce Democrats rejoice  which is understandable but shortsighted  Yes  complete Republican control of Washington isn’t in their interests  spells trouble on several policy fronts and could create a Supreme Court we’d be haunted by for a long time But what just happened in the House of Representatives is in nobody’s interests  inasmuch as it portends squabbling and sclerosis as far as the eye can see  and inasmuch as it assures that the political conversation in this country isn’t going to ripen into anything more constructive and meaningful anytime soon During Boehner’s encounter with the pope  he reportedly agonized aloud over the neckwear he’d chosen  saying that he’d been inclined toward a blue tie but had listened to his staff and gone with green Pope Francis sought to reassure him  saying  through a translator  “Green is the color of hope ”“We’ll need a lot of hope today ” Boehner responded I’m guessing that he had more on his mind than the pope’s imminent remarks to a fractious Congress I’m guessing that he was contemplating what would become of that Congress  and of his party  in the months to come ","headline":{"main":"John Boehner Exits, Donald Trump Storms On","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","kicker":"Op-Ed

over the bigoted comments he has been making recently about Muslims  It is well deserved  and is not a matter of “P C  culture ” as Mr  Carson has claimed  Nor does Mr  Carson represent some minor fringe element in the Republican Party This latest sordid mess to arise from the G O P  nomination contest touches on bedrock American values  constitutional principles and American history  It reflects a pernicious habit among the leaders of the Republican Party to play with fire by pandering to an angry  disaffected and heavily white base by demonizing selected minorities  Muslims are just the current target Mr  Carson declared Sunday on ”Meet the Press” that Muslims are unfit to run for president because a president’s faith should be “consistent with the Constitution ” Later  he told the newspaper The Hill that Islamic Shariah law isn’t consistent with the Constitution because “Muslims feel that their religion is very much a part of your public life and what you do as a public official  and that’s inconsistent with our principles and our Constitution ”Leave aside for a moment the unintentionally funny spectacle of a member of the current Republican Party declaring that religion should be kept out of public life  and that Mr  Carson  as an African American  is a member of a much belittled minority  The freedom of religion embedded in the First Amendment rules out the very idea of a religious test for public office  as John F  Kennedy so eloquently argued and then proved by becoming the first Catholic president As for Shariah law  Catholicism has canon law and Judaism has the Halakha and nobody is painting them as threats to the republic — at least not this year Following Mr  Carson’s comments  some Republicans tried to suggest that anti Muslim feelings existed only in parts of the party’s grass roots base  Some argued that former President George W  Bush drew a line between the country’s antiterrorism efforts after 9 11 and a broader campaign against Muslims  “We’ve worked so hard to try to make it clear that that isn’t the case ” said Tony Fratto  who was a press aide to Mr  Bush  “But each time somebody does this kind of thing  it makes it harder ”But Mr  Carson is hardly alone in his demagogy  Donald Trump has accused President Obama of being foreign born  and is continuing to stoke suspicions that Mr  Obama is a Muslim — a myth that a disturbing number of Republicans believe  Last week  Mr  Trump welcomed a question from a man who asserted “we have a problem in this country  it’s called Muslims ” that “our current president is one ” and the man asked “when can we get rid of them?” Instead of telling the truth  that Mr  Obama is an American born Christian  Mr  Trump said  “We’re going to be looking at that and plenty of other things ”Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina publicly disagreed with Mr  Carson  but neither truly matters in the campaign or the party  Other Republican hopefuls — Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio  and Jeb Bush at least deigned to acknowledge that Mr  Obama is American and is not Muslim  But these efforts have been tepid  at best  because the Republicans are playing to polls that show support for Muslims ranks far below other religious groups among Republicans and Republican leaning voters The phenomenon isn’t new  Claims that Mr  Obama was not a citizen and was a Muslim dogged him since 2008  fanned by people like Mr  Trump  Even in 2012  Republicans did not forthrightly deny the lie  Rick Santorum  for example  grudgingly said  “Well  if Mr  Obama says he’s a Christian  then I have to take him at his word ” Running in 2008  Senator John McCain  at least  shook his head and said “No  Ma’am” when a voter called Mr  Obama an Arab and said he was a “decent family man  citizen ” Former President Bush sometimes said the right things about fighting extremism  not Islam  but instituted a system of detention  torture and trial that applies only to Muslims Anti Muslim sentiment is playing out in the refugee crisis caused by hundreds of thousands of people  mostly Muslims  fleeing wars in the Middle East  The United States recently agreed to take an additional 30 000 refugees per year by 2017  but some conservatives are objecting  claiming they will provide a recruiting pool for radicals  Closing the country’s doors to Muslims would buy into Mr  Carson and Mr  Trump’s vilification and dishonor the thousands of Muslims who have joined Irish  Italians  Germans  French  Jews  Russians  Latinos  Africans and many others in becoming honorable citizens and perhaps  one day  president ","headline":{"main":"The Republican Attack on

tried to tackle climate change in his first term  he pushed Congress to limit and put a price on carbon pollution  but the so called cap and trade bill died in the Senate in 2010  Among the chief reasons  Lawmakers from both parties feared that any law to cut greenhouse gas emissions would harm the nation’s competitiveness compared with China  which was then emerging as the world’s largest polluter Since then  Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have repeatedly cited China’s lack of action on climate change as the chief reason that the United States should not take stronger action On Friday in the Rose Garden  the story of how Washington and Beijing will fight climate change took a stunning turn as President Xi Jinping of China stood with Mr  Obama and announced that China would put in place its own national cap and trade system in 2017  Environmentalists hailed the announcement as historic and said that China’s move should effectively end Republicans’ main objection to enacting a domestic climate change policy “The ironies are rich ” said David Sandalow  a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy and a former senior official in the Obama administration  “Carbon emissions trading is an American idea  Now it’s an American export  The Europeans have moved forward in implementing it  Now the Chinese are embracing it on a large scale ”But news of China’s cap and trade policy did not seem to change the views of a number of Republican presidential candidates “Any deal that our current representatives make with China will allow China to laugh all the way to the bank ” Donald J  Trump  who is leading the Republican field in most polls  said in a statement  “Their negotiators are too smart  sophisticated and cunning for the people representing the U S  I’d much rather wait until I attain office so that we can make a real deal with China and bring jobs and money back to make America great again ”Asked about climate change policy during a CNN interview this week  Mr  Trump said that he did not believe in climate change and that climate change policies “imperil our country ” He also said  “By the way  China’s doing nothing ”In 2012  Mr  Trump posted on Twitter  “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U S  manufacturing noncompetitive ”Other Republican candidates have expressed similar views  At the Sept  16 Republican debate  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said  “We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing  nothing to change our climate  to change our weather  because America is a lot of things  the greatest country in the world  absolutely  But America is not a planet  And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore  China is  And they’re drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of ”Asked on Friday for Mr  Rubio’s response to the Chinese president’s announcement  a spokeswoman for his campaign  Brooke Sammon  wrote in an email  “Marco is opposed to cap and trade and other forms of a national energy tax ” She added  “He has outlined concrete proposals that will help us seize our energy potential without increasing the reach of the E P A ”Jeb Bush  a former Florida governor  has vowed to repeal Mr  Obama’s climate change regulations if he is elected president  Asked about his reaction to China’s announcement  a campaign spokeswoman  Allie Brandenburger  wrote in an email  “The U S  is one of the world’s leaders in reducing greenhouse gasses  We’ve reduced our emissions by 10 percent since 2005  That’s not because of a big government program but largely due to American innovation  That is the right way forward for our economy  families and the nation ”In Congress  Senator James M  Inhofe  the Oklahoma Republican who leads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has called the science of human caused climate change a hoax  was sharply critical of the agreement “These public pledges sound good  but come with serious economic consequences for the United States ” he said in a statement  “The Obama administration will use regulatory overreach to claim our nation’s commitment  while China’s pledge has no guarantee of enforcement  This is a great deal for the Chinese  who are slated to continue increasing emissions with the potential of capping them years from now ”Experts in Chinese climate change policy say there is reason to trust that the Chinese government will move forward with its plans to enact a cap and trade system on its economy — but also cause to be skeptical about whether the plans will be enforced They point out that the Chinese government moved to curb pollution from coal plants and factories not because of pressure from the United States  but after citizen protests against dirty air threatened to disrupt political stability China has been moving toward developing a national cap and trade system for at least three years  In preparation  it has launched seven pilot programs in different provinces  “We are learning from our carbon emissions trading pilots ” said Su Wei  China’s chief climate change negotiator  “First and foremost is the political commitment to carbon markets ”Other experts cautioned that it might be difficult for China to fully carry out the technology and transparent accounting necessary to create a new financial commodity market  When the European Union implemented a cap and trade market  the program suffered in its first years as the price of pollution permits collapsed “We have seen difficulties in various pilot provinces in compliance and accuracy measures about emissions ” said Wang Tao  a resident scholar in the Energy and Climate Program based at the Carnegie Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing In his second term  Mr  Obama has taken on climate change without Congress  Using his executive authority  he worked with the E P A  on a series of regulations  which the E P A  finalized last month  requiring electric utilities to sharply limit carbon pollution  Ultimately  the regulations could lead to the shutdown of hundreds of coal fired power plants Republicans assailed the rules as an abuse of executive authority  a top down fiat — not unlike what might be seen in China ","headline":{"main":"Beijing Puts Ball Back in Washington’s Court on Climate Change","print_headline":"Beijing Puts Ball Back in Washington&#8217;s Court in Fight to Curb Climate Change

the press have focused on his defiant rejection of mannerly rhetoric  his putting into words of what others think privately  But the more important truth is that a half century of Republican policies on race and immigration have made the party the home of an often angry and resentful white constituency — a constituency that is now politically mobilized in the face of demographic upheaval Demographic upheaval may be understating it  From 1970 to 2010  the Hispanic population of the United States grew fivefold  from 9 6 million to 50 5 million  From 2000 to 2010  the number of white children under 18 declined by 4 3 million while the number of Hispanic children grew by 4 8 million  In 2013  white children became a minority  47 7 percent of students ages 3 to 6  We have become familiar with Trump’s selling point — that he  more than any other Republican candidate  voices nativist and protectionist views in aggressive and abrasive terms  without qualm  “I Love the Mexican people  I do business with the Mexican people  but you have people coming through the border that are from all over  And they’re bad  They’re really bad ” He has vilified Latin American immigrants as “bringing drugs  bringing crime” and as “rapists ”Not very subtly  Trump conflates American blacks with Mexican immigrants  “I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension ” he declared in Nashville on Aug  29  “That first night in Baltimore ” when rioting broke out in protest over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody  “they allowed that city to be destroyed  They set it back 35 years in one night because the police weren’t allowed to protect people  We need law and order ”Urban gangs  in turn  provide Trump with an opportunity to link immigration and crime  “You know a lot of the gangs that you see in Baltimore and in St  Louis and Ferguson and Chicago  do you know they’re illegal immigrants?” Trump vows that after the election  “they’re going to be gone so fast  if I win  that your head will spin ”The ease with which Trump has grasped top dog status has provoked apprehension in the Republican establishment –perhaps most vividly in George Will’s comment on the renegade billionaire George Will and other traditional conservatives reject the bombastic language Trump favors  preferring a more elliptical approach in order to avoid alienating moderate voters Republicans need to win in 2016 Trump is going directly after those Republican voters who seek to protect what some scholars call “compositional amenities” – the comfort of a common religion and language  mutually shared traditions  and the minimization of cultural conflict The territory Trump has ventured onto is fertile ground for his brand of demagoguery The Pew Research Center found in a 2012 survey that while all respondents were split  46 48  on the question of whether “the growing number of newcomers threaten traditional American values ” Republicans viewed immigrants as a direct threat to American values  60 32  and conservative Republicans even more so  64 30 A more recent Pew survey in June found that when voters were given a choice between “immigrants burden the country by taking jobs  housing and health care” and “immigrants strengthen the country through hard work and talents ” a majority of those polled  51 41  chose “strengthen the country ” Republicans  however  disagreed  with 63 percent saying immigrants were a burden and 27 percent saying immigrants strengthened the country Responses to the question of whether “discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities” reflect Republican concerns from a different perspective  This question was asked by the Public Religion Research Institute in October 2014  The results demonstrate that not only do a majority of whites  52 percent  agree  but that this agreement is heavily concentrated among conservative constituencies  including Tea Party supporters and white evangelicals In 2013  well before a Trump bid was visible  the polling company Latino Decisions  which specializes in analysis of the Hispanic electorate  developed a survey measure of “openness to diversity ” The measure is based on the strength of support or opposition to 16 statements about possible consequences of immigration  including “a bigger  more diverse workplace will lead to more economic growth”  “there will be too many demands on government services”  “people will become more accepting of their differences and more willing to find common ground”  and “crime and problems in our neighborhood will go up ”In a poll of 2 943 respondents of all races and ethnicities  conducted for the liberal Center for American Progress  the firm found that the groups scoring lowest on the openness to diversity measure were made up of white conservatives  white seniors  white born again Christians and the white working class – all Republican leaning constituencies The Trump phenomenon arguably represents a culmination of the 50 plus year transformation of the Republican Party That transformation was set in motion in 1964  when Barry Goldwater  the Republican presidential nominee  opposed the newly enacted Civil Rights Act  What remained of longstanding black support for the Republican Party disappeared overnight In the four presidential elections before 1964  according to American National Election Studies  Republican candidates had won an average of 30 percent of the minority vote  From 1964 to 2008  the Republican share dropped to an average of 6 1 percent of the minority vote  Since 1964  the Republican Party has become  in effect  a white party The 1964 election began the realignment from Democrat to Republican of the eleven states of the former Confederacy – including the Deep South of South Carolina  Georgia  Alabama  Louisiana and Mississippi — the region most opposed to civil rights and voting rights for black Americans In the wake of the 1964 Johnson Goldwater contest  the national Democratic Party became identified with racial and ethnic liberalism By 1981 82  in large part because of the enfranchisement of blacks after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act  Southern Democrats  once the hard core backers of segregation  moved sharply to the left on racial issues  By 1982  Southern Democrats in the House voted 66 to 6 in favor of legislation strengthening the Voting Rights Act  In the Senate  every Democrat from the Confederate South voted for the legislation The Republican shift to racial conservatism gained momentum under the presidency of Ronald Reagan  who established a record of opposition to civil rights laws A sampling of the Reagan record includes his 1982 attempt to allow schools that practiced racial discrimination to retain tax exemptions  including Bob Jones University  his veto  later overridden  of the 1987 Civil Rights Restoration Act  which barred all federal funds to schools that discriminated More recently  since the 2010 Republican midterm sweep  19 states have enacted a total of 27 laws designed to limit pro Democratic minority turnout by requiring photo identification for voters  by limiting early voting  and by tight regulation of voter registration processes  among other restrictive measures In the case of immigration  Republican opposition to liberal reform legislation was so intense that in 2005 a Republican Congress rejected legislation proposed by its own president  George W  Bush  In January of that year  Bush promised to expend political capital to pass comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to legal status and  ultimately  to citizenship  The Republican controlled House instead passed the Border Protection  Anti Terrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005  That bill amounted to a direct repudiation of the Bush proposal  it included only anti immigrant and tough border provisions  The bill passed the House with Republicans voting 203 to 36 in favor and Democrats opposed 164 to 17  The bill died in the Senate The current prominence of an anti immigrant wing of the Republican Party is part of an international phenomenon  The Trump campaign represents the American iteration of hostility to third world immigration now visible across Europe  where overwhelmingly white right wing parties are flourishing from Greece to Britain  European opposition to immigration  and the strength of this opposition on the political right  was demonstrated in a Pew Research Center study of voters in seven countries — Italy  France  Britain  Spain  Poland  Greece and Germany – that showed that voters on the right were 18 points more likely than voters on the left to agree that “immigrants are a burden because they take jobs and social benefits ”Donald Trump  in other words  is part of a movement gaining momentum among whites across the Northern Hemisphere  The Trump campaign will serve as a measure of the strength of this movement in the United States Trump’s vitriol expresses the degree to which the American debate over immigration has grown ugly  even hideous  At the same time  Trump’s followers are motivated  and enraged  by what they see as a breakdown of law and order and the erosion of norms and standards they believe should be upheld  They are frustrated by the poor performance of the public schools their children attend  by cities and suburbs they believe to be under siege  by a criminal justice system they perceive as dysfunctional  and by a government they view as incompetent Earlier this week Trump added a new campaign commercial  It begins  “JEB BUSH’S THOUGHTS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS” and displays a film clip of Bush saying “Yes  they broke the law  but it’s not a felony  It’s an act of love ” Interspersed are three mug shots  “Francisco Sanchez  Charged with Murder ” “Santana Gaona  Convicted of Murder ” and “Brian Omar Hyde  Charged with Murdering Three People ”“LOVE?” the next screen reads  “Forget Love  It’s Time to Get Tough ”To voters who see the world this way  Trump offers the promise that he can restore a vanished America  that he can “make America great again ” as his campaign puts it  Trump clearly finds this endeavor personally gratifying  even as his odds of winning the nomination remain slim  To his followers  the letdown of defeat could be brutal  leaving them stranded  without a candidate who can successfully capture the intensity of their beliefs ","headline":{"main":"What Donald Trump Understands About Republicans","content_kicker":"Contributing Op-Ed Writer","kicker":"Op-Ed | Thomas B.

last week to accept “the stranger in our midst” and reject a “mind set of hostility” toward newcomers  But his invocation of the millions of Syrian and other Middle East refugees  a relatively small number of whom have been resettled in the United States  has been met with indifference or resistance by many in the 2016 presidential field Some leading Republicans  including Donald J  Trump and Ben Carson  said after the pontiff’s remarks that they continued to oppose accepting refugees in America  a stand that pleases many conservative voters who are suspicious of Muslims  Most of Mr  Trump and Mr  Carson’s rival candidates have mainly used the Syrian crisis as the pretext for attacks over President Obama’s strategy against the Islamic State  also known as ISIS or ISIL Democratic contenders have argued that the chaotic diaspora into Europe calls for an American response — but have offered only modest proposals The implicit question in Francis’ message — what kind of nation does America want to be? — is clashing with the practical realities of current domestic politics  as the presidential candidates court an electorate that is exhausted by global conflicts  divided on the issue of immigration  emotionally scarred by acts of terrorism and far more concerned about wage stagnation  The prospect of taking in 10 000 Syrians next year  as the Obama administration recently proposed  may be the sort of humanitarian goal that Francis was urging  but it does not reflect the inward looking mood of many Americans Republican candidates have been striving for months to channel the grievances of voters who feel angry or alienated  and as Mr  Trump’s rise in the polls shows  he has unquestionably done this best  At a recent rally in New Hampshire  he allowed an audience member to excoriate Muslims and assert that Mr  Obama was one  then switched his position on Syrian refugees from taking some in  “You have to ” he said on Sept  8  to rejecting them all In an interview Friday  Mr  Trump held fast  “With all due respect  the pope didn’t change my mind ” he said “I have a big heart  but we as a country need to say  ‘We have to get our own act together ’ ” he added  “We cannot take the chance that thousands of ISIS militants will sneak in among the migrants  The last thing we need is a big surprise  which we’ve had before  We can’t even create a website that works for Obamacare  How are we supposed to screen undocumented Syrians?”While Hillary Rodham Clinton has accused Mr  Trump of preying on “paranoia and prejudice” among voters  neither she nor other leading candidates have proposed detailed plans to deal with the humanitarian and security crises in Syria and the region The focus so far has been on numerical goals for Syrian resettlement in the United States and the need for rigorous screening to block potential terrorists Some candidates have also framed the subject as a test of national character — while opponents of accepting Syrians see it instead as a test of national fortitude Mrs  Clinton  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov  Martin O’Malley of Maryland each favor admitting 65 000 Syrians to the United States next year — or more in the case of Mr  O’Malley  who has been the most outspoken on Syria as he tries to gain traction in the Democratic nomination fight  The Democrats argue that America has a moral obligation to take in people in need and help Europe manage the worst refugee crisis since World War II Some Republicans share that philosophy  including former Gov  Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  In an interview after the pope’s address to Congress on Thursday  Mr  Graham said he would support the Obama administration’s plan to accept 10 000 next year with a sufficient screening process If the United States fails to act  Mr  Graham said early this month  “we should take the Statue of Liberty and tear it down ”Mr  Bush has not said how many people he would accept  nor has Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or Gov  John Kasich of Ohio  though they have indicated they would take in some  All four Republicans have pledged to do more to address a cause of the crisis by defeating Islamic State militants Even the 65 000 people whom Democrats want to resettle in the United States would make little difference for the roughly four million Syrians already displaced from their country  refugee and human rights groups say “We’re falling short of our values as a nation if our presidential candidates can’t come forward with comprehensive plans for a tragedy that is playing out daily ” said Eva A  Millona  the executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition  “We’ve had so many phone calls from people here in Newton  Lexington  Arlington who would lead by opening their homes to Syrian families  This is a moment of truth for candidates to show how they would lead as well ”For Mr  Trump and several other Republicans seeking support from hard line conservative voters  national security concerns take precedence in weighing whether to admit migrants and refugees Mr  Trump has suggested creating “safe zones” in Syria that could be protected with American air power  an idea that Mr  Graham also supports  Three other Republican presidential candidates — Mr  Carson  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Gov  Mike Huckabee of Arkansas — have endorsed humanitarian assistance  but have focused more on warning that the United States lacks a vetting process to weed out terrorists   The current screening process typically takes 18 to 24 months  “We could be inviting some of the most violent and vicious people on Earth to come right in here and live among our families ” Mr  Huckabee  a Baptist preacher  said in a radio interview after Francis said Thursday that “we must not be taken aback by their numbers  but rather view them as persons ”The pope’s admonitions collide with the fears of many Americans about terrorism and the government’s ability to keep out dangerous foreigners like the two Iraqi refugees in Kentucky who pleaded guilty in 2012 to charges that they tried to send weapons and money to Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq “I think Ted Cruz has real intellectual integrity about keeping the country safe and being very careful about letting in Syrians and other people  and Trump is right to focus on safety  too ” said Holly St  Peter of North Hampton  N H   who attended Mr  Trump’s recent rally Anxiety over infiltration by terrorists crosses party lines  President Obama’s director of national intelligence  James R  Clapper  said this month that the possibility that Islamic State operatives could sneak into the country among refugees was “a huge concern of ours ”Yet the screening system for migrants and refugees is aggressive  administration officials say  with only about 1 400 Syrians accepted into the United States over the last two years Mr  Obama has proposed taking in 10 000 Syrian migrants in 2016 and  separately  increasing the cap on the number of worldwide refugees accepted each year by the United States to 100 000  from 70 000  Refugees are people who are escaping persecution and can offer proof  while migrants may be leaving home for economic reasons Mr  Graham  a hawk on many national security matters  said he believed vetting systems were crucial but rarely perfect  “The risk of doing nothing is greater than taking vetted people ” he added  emphasizing the need to take pressure off Jordan  Lebanon and other neighbors of Syria — as well as European allies — by absorbing more of the displaced “A year from now  if we don’t stop the complete unraveling of Syria  this crisis will look so much worse ” he said  “What happens when the neighboring countries begin to collapse? What happens when other countries become overwhelmed with Syrian refugees and their own people are at risk? There’s no good end to this if we don’t act ”","headline":{"main":"Politics and Philosophy Clash Where the Pope Urges an Embrace of Refugees","content_kicker":"Francis in America","kicker":"Francis in America","print_headline":"Politics and Philosophy Clash Where the Pope Urges an Embrace of Refugees"},"wordCount":"1324"},

unity  Donald J  Trump overwhelmed the first Republican presidential debate on Thursday night by ripping into his rivals and the moderators alike  but also drew fire from Jeb Bush and others who are seeking to stop his breathtaking surge Mr  Trump displayed his trademark pugnacity from the start with a bravura moment  refusing to rule out a third party run for the presidency if he does not win the party’s nomination  Facing loud boos from audience members in a Cleveland sports arena  he held his hand up in defiance as several other Republicans looked flabbergasted “I have to respect the person that  if it’s not me  the person that wins ” said Mr  Trump  the billionaire businessman and reality television star who has attracted fans in part by showing a lack of respect for politicians like Mr  Bush  who Mr  Trump has said should not be president  He then quipped  “If I’m the nominee  I will pledge I will not run as an independent ”The much anticipated meeting was something of a showcase for several candidates who had yet to generate much heat in the Republican primary field  Gov  John Kasich of Ohio fluidly described his fiscal leadership in the state and spoke bigheartedly about the mentally ill and the poor  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida showed a command of policy and an eagerness for the fight with Democrats  And Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin deftly defended an absolutist position against abortion while boasting of his three statewide victories in his own swing state Others struggled to grab the attention they needed to shore up their fund raising or broaden their appeal beyond niche constituencies  The retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas both effectively delivered well honed talking points and one liners  but did not leave dramatically new impressions Mr  Trump’s outsize presence in the two hour debate  shown on Fox News  was an emphatic reminder that  after eight years out of power  Republicans’ quest to regain the presidency will be complicated in the months ahead by their own internal divisions  While Mr  Trump may not ultimately become the nominee  his appeal among some conservatives has underscored how hungry many in the party’s base are for an uncompromising and authentic figure who will challenge the political order Unpredictable and often rambunctious  the Republican gathering was anything but a tentative affair  unlike so many other first debates of campaign cycles  Mr  Trump repeatedly made the most of his center stage position  and ensured he would star in weeks of video clips In addition to refusing to rule out a third party bid and sparring with the Fox News moderators  he boasted that the Clintons attended his third wedding because he demanded it and said  “Our politicians are stupid” while dismissing President George W  Bush’s tenure as “a catastrophe ”In the first of the debate’s many freewheeling moments  Mr  Trump’s statement drew an instant  contemptuous retort from Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky  who nodded to Mr  Trump’s past donations to Hillary Rodham Clinton “He buys and sells politicians of all stripes ” Mr  Paul said  “So if he doesn’t run as a Republican  maybe he supports Clinton  or maybe he runs as an independent?”Mr  Trump — whose withering put downs have become legendary  his favorite pejorative being “loser” — was true to form in dismissing Mr  Paul “Well  I’ve given him plenty of money ” he said Even as some of the other Republicans showed moments of strength  with Mr  Paul frequently going on the attack  it was little match for the bombast of Mr  Trump Establishment oriented Republicans had hoped that two terms of President Obama would make grass roots activists pragmatic about 2016  perhaps rallying around a well known  well financed candidate like Mr  Bush  But the popularity of Mr  Trump’s message suggested that the party’s rank and file were just as interested in finding a pugilist Mr  Trump and Mr  Bush  who have been lashing out at each other for weeks  mostly over tone and fitness to be president  barely tangled at all  But near the end of the debate  in a moment that encapsulated the race  Mr  Bush said that Mr  Trump  who has portrayed some Mexican immigrants as rapists  was a “divisive” figure who would ensure that Republicans continued to lose “I want to win ” Mr  Bush said  participating in his first debate in 13 years  “We’re not going to win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day  dividing the country  saying  creating a grievance kind of environment  We’re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful  optimistic message ”Mr  Trump shot back that the threats against the United States were too urgent for such concerns about “tone ”“When you have people that are cutting Christians’ heads off  when you have a world at the border and at so many places that it’s medieval times ” Mr  Trump said  “we don’t have time for tone — we have to go out and get the job done ”The exchange of fire between Mr  Trump and Mr  Bush — the dominant figures in the race  and two American household names — offered a preview of the broader debate to come between Republicans who believe the party must be more inclusive to win the presidency again and those determined to speak to the boiling anger in the conservative grass roots  Few of the fights were over policy  however  Mr  Trump  for one  offered few substantive details about his plans for the country A trio of Fox News moderators  delving deep into the records of the 10 candidates  posed a series of difficult questions  while also trying  with occasional success  to provoke arguments among them over areas of disagreement  In the first question directly to Mr  Trump  for instance  Megyn Kelly cited his negative comments about some women  whom he has called “fat pigs” and “slobs ” before Mr  Trump cut her off “Only Rosie O’Donnell ” he said  clearly looking for a laugh “For the record  it was well beyond Rosie O’Donnell ” Ms  Kelly said “Yes  I’m sure it was ” Mr  Trump replied  before offering an explanation that reflected his tell it like it is sensibilities “I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct ” he said  “I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness  And to be honest with you  this country doesn’t have time either  This country is in big trouble ” He went on to complain about rough treatment by Ms  Kelly Occasional alliances appeared to form among candidates  intentionally or not  Mr  Rubio and Mr  Kasich each flattered Mr  Trump by saying that he had hit a nerve with his tough talk about illegal immigration and other problems facing the United States  Mr  Trump and Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey took turns belittling Mr  Paul  who has been struggling in polls and fund raising  and who kept on the attack against Mr  Trump and other rivals throughout the debate In the sharpest exchange of the night between candidates  Mr  Paul and Mr  Christie  who have traded shots from afar over national security for more than two years  exchanged personal insults in a back and forth over surveillance and civil liberties After Mr  Paul said he only wanted to seek the phone records of terrorists  not average citizens  Mr  Christie called that “a completely ridiculous answer” — and then went further “When you’re sitting in a subcommittee  just blowing hot air about this  you can say things like that ” Mr  Christie said Mr  Paul  his voice rising  said Mr  Christie misunderstood the Bill of Rights and then offered his own stinging rejoinder “I don’t trust President Obama with our records ” he said  before lowering the boom with a reference to the embrace between Mr  Obama and Mr  Christie after Hurricane Sandy in 2012  a moment that still haunts Mr  Christie with conservatives  “I know you gave him a big hug ”Boos and cheers from the audience quickly enveloped the exchange on stage  Mr  Christie  seemingly ready for the attack  shot back that the hugs he recalled were with “the families who lost their people on Sept  11 ”The moderators tried to incite a confrontation between Mr  Bush and Mr  Rubio  who were once allies in Florida politics but now hope to bury each other’s candidacies in the March primary there  pressing them over Mr  Bush’s support for the Common Core education standards  But Mr  Rubio went to higher ground and discussed school reform without disparaging Mr  Bush  one of several moments when he struck a positive tone about his fellow Republicans Mr  Rubio did go on the offensive against Mrs  Clinton  the leading Democratic presidential candidate  painting her as out of touch with the financial struggles of many Americans “If I’m our nominee  how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?” Mr  Rubio asked  “I was raised paycheck to paycheck ”Later  he expanded on the hit  “God has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates ” he said  “The Democrats can’t even find one ”Mr  Kasich struck one of the most empathetic notes when he was asked what he would say to one of his daughters if she came out as gay  given that he opposes same sex marriage “I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay ” Mr  Kasich said  “Because someone doesn’t think the way I do doesn’t mean that I can’t care about them or can’t love them ” He added  to cheers  that he would say “that of course I would love them  And I would accept them  because you know what  that’s what we’re taught when we have strong faith ”Even though Mr  Trump’s shadow loomed large for much of the two hour debate  other Republicans on stage demonstrated why many in the party believe they have one of the best presidential fields in decades Mr  Walker appeared fluent on policy and emerged untouched by rivals  And Mr  Kasich  who had barely made the debate cut  won repeated applause from the home state crowd and suggested he could be a threat to Mr

candidate’s most devoted supporters could be forgiven for trying to tune out the torrent of campaign emails  Twitter messages  Facebook posts  Instagrams and Snapchats that steadily flood voters’ inboxes and social media feeds in this digitized  pixelated  endlessly streaming election cycle But a text message is different A text message — despite its no frills  retro essence — is something personal  Something invasive  Something almost guaranteed to be read So last month  when Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont staged what his aides called the most important night of his three month old campaign for the Democratic nomination — cramming 100 000 of his followers into house parties from coast to coast  to whip them into foot soldiers — he did not solicit email addresses or corral the attendees into a special Facebook group  Instead  his digital organizing director  Claire Sandberg  asked each participant to send a quick text establishing contact with the campaign “We need to turn crowds and popular support and Bernie into winning ” she said over a video hookup  “So everyone  please  take out your smartphone right now and text the word ‘work ’ ”Within hours  the Sanders campaign said  it received nearly 50 000 responses The killer app for the 2016 presidential campaign is not an app at all  It is not even new  Texting — that 1990s vintage technology — has suddenly become a go to vehicle for presidential campaigns when they need to get a message out as widely and quickly as possible  and with confidence that it will be read Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Hillary Rodham Clinton asked voters to text them during speeches announcing their campaigns this year  an indication of the ease with which cellphone numbers can be collected to build a database of supporters  The candidates’ one line appeals could do the work of dozens of volunteers roaming the crowds with clipboards Mr  Sanders’s campaign is structuring the foundation of its vast volunteer effort through texting and linking to a mobile module on its website  And aides to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky sent text messages rallying his supporters to sign petitions and express support for him online while he gave an hourslong Senate floor speech in May about the National Security Agency surveillance program Of course  candidates have experimented with text messages for years  President Obama’s 2008 campaign tried to announce his vice presidential choice by text  though news organizations beat him to it  I n 2012  his campaign amassed about one million cellphone numbers but  an aide recalled  never set up a campaign team to exploit them In those campaign cycles  political text messages could seem more jarring “A text is almost a sacred thing ” said Vincent Harris  the digital director for Mr  Paul’s campaign  “This space is reserved for your closest friends  your family  people who know you well enough to have your number and bypass a voice mail or email  I think it’s taken several years for the electorate to warm up to this ”Mr  Harris recalled a “largely unsuccessful” texting campaign for Bob McDonnell during his winning race for governor of Virginia in 2009  when voters refused to surrender their cellphone numbers even after they were offered free tickets to a Washington Redskins game But since then  as social media use has exploded  people’s attitudes toward text messages have shifted  Now that they routinely accept interruptions on their cellphones for traffic and weather alerts  Uber pickups  restaurant reservations and hair salon appointment reminders  they are just as likely to welcome hearing from someone they want to see in the White House Above all  candidates are texting to build crowds  which in turn helps generate news media coverage that is like oxygen to the more than 20 candidates  As Mr  Sanders toured the West Coast recently  for example  supporters at each stop received texts ahead of time promoting his appearance  More than 27 000 turned out in Los Angeles What gives texting its political power is its ability to cut through a lot of other advertising noise  targeted posts on Facebook and Twitter  web video commercials and the pitter patter of emails pleading for campaign contributions A text message  by contrast  offers the nearest thing a candidate can get to ensuring that a message will be opened and read Texting can also be useful in reaching younger voters  who can be harder to contact through other means As commonplace as they have become  though  text messages still feel somewhat personal and intrusive  So campaigns are being careful about when and how to use them — and creative about how to forestall irritation  Mrs  Clinton’s campaign replied to every text message sent after her June rally on Roosevelt Island in New York City with an inside joke  a photo of Mrs  Clinton  wearing sunglasses and glaring at her BlackBerry  that spawned the “Texts From Hillary” meme and blog This is not to say texting will replace email as the primary tool for reaching out to voters  For one thing  the inherent pushiness of a text message comes at a price  Sending 50 000 texts can cost  500  Charges for mass emails are a fraction of that And email still dominates in soliciting smaller donations  although that could change  Technology firms like Blue State Digital  on the left  and IMGE  on the right  are trying to perfect ways to allow voters to authorize donations by texting But asking for money too often can get on voters’ nerves  Fast “People who will walk around with like 20 000 unread emails will still want to clear the notification circle on the text messages ” said Joe Rospars  the chief executive of Blue State Digital  “But there’s two sides to that  You can also quickly annoy people ”Too many emails can be ignored or filtered into the trash  But too many texts can cause a much more visceral reaction — perhaps turning off a voter completely and irrevocably Excess “can be unforgivable on text ” said Laura Olin  who helped manage the Obama campaign’s text messaging in 2012  “because you are getting into people’s faces ”","headline":{"main":"Texting Comes of Age as a

Democrats followed their Republican counterparts’ debates with their first of the election season  pitting the previously presumed front runner Hillary Rodham Clinton against the crowd drawing upstart Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the implied threat of Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  But for Mrs  Clinton  it was a good fight It was the best day of Mrs  Clinton’s campaign After months of news media focus on Mrs  Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state — and little by way of a cohesive message from the candidate to combat those questions — she was widely praised for her performance in the party’s first debate on Tuesday night In a debate that was wonkier  more nuanced and less bombastic than the two prime time Republican face offs  Mrs  Clinton didn’t shy away from challenging Mr  Sanders  her main opponent  And after two hours  it was difficult to discern how much of an opening remains for Mr  Biden to enter the race Mrs  Clinton seemed loose but energetic  poised but not overly polished  as she faced three questions out of the gate about her changes in positions on issues over the years and what it said about her character She dominated Mr  Sanders in an exchange about gun control  an issue where his record has prompted skepticism among some Democrats  She was the only person to raise the controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood  to great applause She fluidly turned questions about her vote authorizing military force in Iraq  a move that helped cost her the presidential nomination in 2008  The debate moved on after that  in the clearest indication yet that the Democratic Party has as well  And she talked proudly about serving under President Obama  Areas of weakness were her positions on Wall Street excesses  which will be raised down the road  Her remark about not having taken a position on the Keystone XL pipeline until her statements last week — belatedly  and to some criticism for that delay — was not well delivered Mr  Sanders’s struggles explaining his position on guns — he mentioned that he comes from a rural state — will linger  So will his absolution of Mrs  Clinton on the emails issue  Her broadest smile came when he said people should let go of the “damn emails ” The two shook hands  as Mr  Sanders essentially took the issue off the table for himself Mr  Sanders needed to convince people that he is presidential  a bar he appeared to have trouble clearing  But the audience for this debate is deeply liberal  and Mr  Sanders is unlikely to lose support  Mr  Sanders  who is seen by some as a candidate with limited appeal  remained true to himself  repeatedly describing himself as a “Democratic socialist” and talking about a “political revolution ”Martin O’Malley  the former Maryland governor  performed effectively  although  like the others  he seemed reluctant to hit Mrs  Clinton too hard  He and Mrs  Clinton made Mr  Sanders seem uncertain as they jointly piled on him over gun control  Though he did not have a major breakout moment  Mr  O’Malley seems to have positioned himself to get another look  The presences of Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb were barely felt Mr  Biden  whose aides said was watching the debate from his residence at the Naval Observatory  will soon be making his decision  His candidacy was always going to be predicated on a flagging Mrs  Clinton – there was less evidence of that on Tuesday night  — Maggie HabermanDebate Coverage  A Sharp Contest and Spin Room Frenzy— Mrs  Clinton turned up the heat on Mr  Sanders — The Democrats on the issues — Mr  Sanders was trapped in a post debate scrum An In Depth Dive  Moment to Moment and Claim by ClaimThe candidates covered a lot of ground in the debate  Here are some of the highlights from The Times’s live blog — During the debate  Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders showed themselves as deeply split on the use of force — The issue of immigration provided a clear example of the divide between the two parties — Criticizing Mrs  Clinton  Mr  O’Malley says there is a need for new leadership And here are some looks at the context behind some of the candidates’ claims — Mrs  Clinton’s statements on the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Keystone XL pipeline and her email server — Mr  Sanders’s claims on guns  on minority joblessness and financial overhaul — Mr  O’Malley’s comments linking climate change to unrest in the Middle East What We’re Watching Today—  Mrs  Clinton will hold a rally in Las Vegas  while Madeleine Albright  the former secretary of state  will campaign for her in Iowa  Mr  Sanders will hold a fund raising event in Hollywood —  As the Republicans set about to counter  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will hold a town hall style event in New Hampshire  Jeb

memoir released this week  Mr  Bernanke  the former Federal Reserve chairman  describes the presidents and Treasury secretaries he worked with in deeply respectful  not particularly revealing terms  It’s hardly the gossipy  blunt assessments that can turn a high official’s memoir into juicy reading But precisely because of this fact  Mr  Bernanke’s occasional tough criticisms — of people like his hawkish Fed colleague Thomas Hoenig and the senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders — stand out as revelatory about the man who guided the United States economy through its most perilous period in modern times  He shows impatience with the messy maw of democracy  implicitly contrasting the bombast of many politicians with the orderly  thoughtful decision making that was taking place inside the Bernanke Fed The broad themes and many factual details in Mr  Bernanke’s book have been told before  His book comes out well after the memoirs of two close partners in the era of crisis fighting  Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner  and the narrative of the 2007 to 2009 crisis has been told in multiple journalistic accounts and an HBO movie  In terms of economic philosophy and rationale for his actions  Mr  Bernanke presented those in a series of lectures in 2013 that were themselves collected in a short book But even as someone who covered intensively the events Mr  Bernanke retells and who has read all those previous books  and wrote one of them   I found the book to be worthwhile reading  It’s just not for the usual reasons one reads a senior government official’s memoir  If the basic narrative of what happened during the crisis and what the Bernanke Fed was thinking is already well established  the book sheds light on many of the smaller dramas that hang over this crucial period of world economic history Which brings us back to Bernie Sanders and Tom Hoenig A recurring theme in the book is Mr  Bernanke’s frustration with dissenters — colleagues at the Fed who disagreed with central bank interventionism  especially when that disagreement was logged publicly  Beneath the surface of these pages is an appreciation for those who play an inside game of behind closed doors debate  and disdain for those who fight their policy battles in a more strident  ideological  public way In August 2008  just before the Lehman Brothers collapse would send the global economy into a tailspin  Mr  Bernanke was primarily worried about financial stability and possible recession  But many of his Fed colleagues were more focused on soaring energy prices and the risks of high inflation  and therefore wanted tighter money “I find myself conciliating holders of the unreasonable opinion that we should be tightening even as the economy and financial system are in a precarious position and inflation commodity pressures appear to be easing ” Mr  Bernanke wrote in an email to his vice chairman  Donald Kohn  It had the subject line of “WWGD ” meaning “What would Greenspan do?”“Too many dissents  I worried  could undermine our credibility ” Mr  Bernanke writes in his book Two years later  as the Fed weighed a second round of its controversial program of quantitative easing  known as QE2  he became particularly irritated at how Mr  Hoenig  then the president of the Kansas City Fed  waged a public campaign against the effort After a “Businessweek” profile  Mr  Hoenig “appeared to be enjoying the attention ” Mr  Bernanke writes  “I respected his right to dissent  to ask public questions  and to publicly explain his stance  But now I thought he risked undermining public confidence in the Fed and disrupting the committee’s deliberative process by staking out inflexible positions before hearing other committee members’ views ”Mr  Bernanke’s comments about political leaders show similar disdain  particularly those on the ideological ends of both parties  describing the efforts on Fed transparency from Mr  Sanders of Vermont and the former representative Ron Paul of Texas in parallel terms “Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  a self described socialist who caucused with Democrats  seemed to see the world as a vast conspiracy of big corporations and the wealthy ” he writes  adding parenthetically  “Corporations and the wealthy have lots of power  certainly  but in the real world most bad things happen because of ignorance  incompetence  or bad luck  not as a result of grand conspiracies ”If anything  he is more disdainful of the political shifts in his own party  “It seemed to me that the crisis had helped to radicalize large parts of the Republican Party ” he writes He repeatedly expresses disdain for the hypocrisy of members of Congress  When his confirmation for a second term as Fed chairman was in doubt in January 2010  he was “disturbed” while working the phones with senators who were weighing their vote and indicated they supported him but couldn’t vote for confirmation  “The callers seemed to believe that voting in opposition to their personal views for political reasons was perfectly natural ” he writes  He quotes one senator as saying “sometimes you just have throw some red meat to the knuckle draggers ”By contrast  when Mr  Bernanke writes of people he disagreed with at times but who played an inside game — fighting those battles quietly in meetings in conference rooms within government buildings — he holds his fire If you parse Mr  Bernanke’s words carefully and know some back story  you can discern how he disagreed with Larry Summers  when he was an Obama White House official  over the wisdom of nationalizing troubled banks  or with the European Central Bank president Jean Claude Trichet over the wisdom of fiscal austerity in 2010  But they earn none of the open annoyance he levels at his rivals who lodged more public campaigns Mr  Bernanke was a career academic who ventured into the center of the world’s most powerful democracy and seems frequently appalled by what he saw “A dose of populism is healthy for any democracy ” Mr  Bernanke writes  “But in extreme forms  on either the left or the right  populism can also lead to cynical manipulation of legitimate public

And the fact that he’s a little quirky could almost have some appeal ”Here in Ames  that much was clear at least among the crowd of 250 college students  liberal activists and retirees who packed a church basement to hear Mr  Sanders  Using a milk crate as a podium  he delivered the kind of tirade for which he is well known in Washington  He did not mention his encounter with the police officer He railed against big banks  “Break ’em up    fretted over climate change and income inequality  and deplored the high cost of a college education  “Totally moronic ”   He embraced a single payer health system  “Guess what everybody  Health care is a right ”   proposed strengthening labor unions and lamented a lack of voter participation  “All over this country people are throwing up their hands in despair ”  But Mr  Sanders reserved his greatest ire for what he called “one extreme right wing billionaire family ” the brothers Charles and David Koch  In his view  they are the root of what is wrong in American politics “The Koch brothers are worth  85 billion  You might think that’s enough to get by  leave a couple of bucks to your kids ” the senator thundered  his voice rising  face reddening  “But apparently they feel an obligation to destroy Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid ”The crowd lapped it up  “We need a debate in the Democratic Party about where we’re going ” said Sandy Easter  65  an alternative healer and homeopath who distributed “Run  Bernie  Run” stickers  “I think he’s folksy — the real thing ”But quirky and folksy can take a candidate only so far  and Mr  Sanders is hardly without liabilities  For starters  there is the socialist label “That’s something that Bernie is going to have to overcome ” conceded Tad Devine  a Democratic strategist who is advising Mr  Sanders  “He is going to have to convince people he is a serious  credible candidate ”Mr  Sanders will turn 75 in 2016  After three decades in public office  he cannot exactly market himself as new or fresh  the way Barack Obama did in 2008 or Mr  Sanders’s fellow Vermonter Howard Dean  who has endorsed Mrs  Clinton  did in 2004 And Mr  Sanders has competition  Liberal groups like MoveOn org are mounting a campaign to draft a populist with a far larger national following  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  even though she insists she is not running On a recent morning in the Capitol  the two senators could be found in opposite corners of the private Senate dining room  Over a Vermont worthy breakfast of yogurt with granola and berries  with a touch of Brooklyn English muffin on the side   Mr  Sanders called Ms  Warren a friend  and said he had discussed his intentions with her “Private conversation ” he said  waving off questions about specifics  Pressed on whether he would run if she did  he flashed his prickly side  “Look ” he said  “Elizabeth is over there  You want to talk to her? Go talk to her ”People think Mr  Sanders  with his socialist leanings and unruly shock of white hair that evokes mad scientist references on Twitter  ought to be funny  but he is stone cold serious  That trait earns him respect in the Senate  but could give his campaign a mandatory seminarlike quality “He seems rather humorless ” said Michael Kazin  a Georgetown University historian who wrote in The New Republic this spring that a Sanders run would be good for Democrats Mr  Dean has a different take  “Bernie actually does have a sense of humor ” he said  “But I would agree it’s well concealed ”The son of a Polish born paint salesman who “came to this country without a nickel in his pocket ” Mr  Sanders grew up listening to his parents fight about money  a fact that he says shaped his political views  He says wryly that “unlike  historically  most of my colleagues in this institution ” the Senate  he does not wake up each morning with visions of the Oval Office  “I honestly believe anybody who really  really wants to become president is a little bit crazy  because the problems facing this country and the world are so overwhelming ”He wonders if he is the man who can solve them  So a few months ago  he had a heart to heart with Mr  Devine  who has advised him in previous races Mr  Devine said Mr  Sanders should not be underestimated  he raised  8 million for his 2012 election  without a serious opponent  and still has nearly  4 5 million in the bank  He has enthusiastic followers on Facebook and Twitter But in order to avoid being dismissed as a gadfly  Mr  Devine said he told the senator that he would have to raise about  50 million  presumably through small online contributions  Not only that  he would have to build a ground operation in states like Iowa and New Hampshire and run as a Democrat to avoid being seen as a spoiler “He is going to have to convince millions of people that he’s got a real candidacy ” Mr  Devine said Thus the trip to Iowa  Mr  Sanders’s fourth visit to the state this year  He has also been to California  New Hampshire  South Carolina and Mississippi — part of an effort  he said  to figure out if he can indeed recruit millions into an “unprecedented grass roots campaign ” He said he will decide over the next few months  based on “gut reaction ” if he should run Matthew Covington  an organizer for the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action Fund  which has been hosting events for Mr  Sanders around the state  said he hoped Mr  Sanders would  After the event in Ames  Mr  Covington said Mr  Sanders was “laying out ideas and policy proposals that resonate with a lot of people ”But could he win?

The story of a lesbian cartoonist and her relationship with her closeted gay father  “Fun Home” is about facing difficult truths and the tragic consequences when we don’t — the very message  as it happens  that the Sanders campaign is offering to America about income inequality and climate change  Compared with the flashy big budget musical “An American in Paris ” which was the safe bet to win the Tony  “Fun Home” looked like a fringe contender  too dark and offbeat to have wide appeal  not unlike certain politicians who are easily dismissed as quixotic nonfactors In other words  “Fun Home” isn’t the sort of musical you imagine on Broadway — just as Mr  Sanders isn’t the sort of politician you imagine in the White House   He would be the first socialist president  after all  What does it take for an underdog to succeed? In politics and on Broadway  two worlds I’ve covered as a reporter  some of the factors are similar  Message and perseverance are crucial  Money — not a fortune  but at least enough — is essential  And authenticity matters most of all Underdog candidates like Harry S  Truman in 1948 and Barack Obama in the 2008 primary contest struck many voters as authentic leaders who were willing to speak truth to power  Truman railing against a “do nothing Congress ” Mr  Obama opposing the American invasion of Iraq  and who did not try to be all things to all voters  Truman was quintessentially Midwestern and didn’t shy away from his roots  no matter what coastal elites thought of him  Mr  Obama was the first black presidential nominee and didn’t shy away from his race  giving an eloquent speech in the face of controversy over his Chicago pastor  Many Americans came to see both men as the real deal “Underdogs succeed when the voters are in a certain zone — I call it ‘the voter zone’ — where they are looking for something  and the underdog candidate taps into that something ” said Tad Devine  a veteran Democratic consultant who is advising Mr  Sanders  “It can be a set of issues  attitudes or beliefs that voters feel are being overlooked by the front running candidates  If the underdog can get into the voter zone with the voters by themselves  and if they are credible  they can win despite the odds ”Both “Fun Home” and “An American in Paris” had plenty of credibility in the run up to the Tony Awards  They were winning over critics and filling seats with paying customers  two meaningful measures in the eyes of the 844 Tony voters eligible to cast ballots for best musical  But “Fun Home” had a freshness that appealed to many liberals among the Tony electorate  Shows about lesbians are rare on Broadway  Its producers  meanwhile  had shown perseverance by developing the musical for years and raising enough money   5 2 million  to transfer it from the Public Theater  Off Broadway  to Broadway And unlike the beautiful people and plot contrivances of “An American in Paris ” the relationships and emotions in “Fun Home” felt deeply authentic  a family of normal looking people where love and loyalty mixed with resentments and rancor   Come to think of it  the father’s bad haircut brings to mind Mr  Sanders’s messy mop  “A lot of people loved ‘Fun Home ’ but they also believed in what it was about and wanted to see it win ” said Scott Sanders  a veteran Broadway producer  who is not related to the senator  Underdog victories can be fleeting  of course  The musical “Nine” beat “Dreamgirls” for the Tony in 1982  but “Dreamgirls” has become the more cherished title  Another upset win came in 2004 when “Avenue Q” triumphed over “Wicked” — yet “Wicked” is the one about to hit  4 billion in global ticket sales  In politics  former Gov  Howard Dean of Vermont — also Mr  Sanders’s home state — had the antiwar message and political authenticity  “I’m here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party”  that pleased many party members in the 2004 presidential primaries  but came up short to the establishment candidate  Senator John Kerry  And Senator Sanders may be attracting attention to his message by drawing large crowds  like the thousand people who turned out for him this month in Keene  N H   but Mrs  Clinton is sure to attract a sea of fans to her rallies on Roosevelt Island on Saturday and in Des Moines on Sunday “Like Eugene McCarthy in 1968  Sanders will offer a way to cast a protest vote in a primary against Hillary Clinton  but I don’t expect him to register much support beyond that ” said Douglas E  Schoen  a Democratic strategist who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton Dare to dream  the underdogs reply  Take the fight for same sex marriage  It was a long shot movement for years  but perseverance  through legal and political fights  and authenticity  the love and commitment of same sex couples  have helped changed policies and attitudes across the country “It’s the underdogs who dare to push the envelope  who dare to take risks  and who dare to be different ” said Chad Griffin  president of the Human Rights Campaign  a gay rights group  “In doing so  it’s the underdogs who prove the pessimists wrong and push the world forward ”Among those rooting for Senator Sanders is Alison Bechdel  who wrote the graphic memoir “Fun Home ” which was adapted into the musical  Like Mr  Sanders  Ms  Bechdel lives near Burlington  Vt   and she has been a political supporter of his for years  And if an underdog like “Fun Home” can win  she said  maybe he can surprise people  too “People kept saying that we were too small and challenging to beat something big and comforting like ‘American in Paris ’ ’’ Ms  Bechdel said  “This is where the analogy between ‘Fun Home’ and presidential politics is interesting  People say they won’t support a candidate who they think is unelectable  But if enough people vote for the candidate  what happens? They will get elected  You just need enough voters to go with their heart ”","headline":{"main":"Bernie Sanders Can Take Heart From a Broadway Champ","content_kicker":"News Analysis","kicker":"News Analysis","print_headline":"Can America Back an Underdog?

not\" plea for 2016  brushing past signs of a Hillary Rodham Clinton resurgence with fresh and direct suggestions he could be on the verge of entering the presidential race The vice president's political team broke its months long silence on the subject with a letter circulated by one of Biden's closest friends and top advisers  In the letter  though Biden is still officially undecided  former Sen  Ted Kaufman describes a \"campaign from the heart\" that Biden would wage and says a decision isn't far off \"If he decides to run  we will need each and every one of you — yesterday \" Kaufman says temptingly  alluding to the breakneck speed at which Biden would have to ramp up a campaign To its recipients — Biden's former Senate  White House and campaign staffers — Thursday's letter smacked of an unambiguous indication Biden was all but green lighting a presidential campaign  Several individuals familiar with the letter say it was circulated with Biden's blessing  The individuals weren't authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity For his part  Biden has been silent on the issue for weeks while allowing his own self imposed deadlines to fly by  His indecision has led many Democratic leaders to publicly write off his prospects  particularly as Clinton revels in a strong debate performance and an impressive stretch of fundraising  solidifying her status as the Democratic front runner Clinton and Sen  Bernie Sanders both announced this week they'd raised more than  25 million in their last three month stretch  a potent reminder that many of the Democratic establishment's donors and top players have already committed to a declared candidate To some Democrats  Biden runs the risk of being perceived as a spoiler at this point  drawing votes away from Clinton without any substantial prospect for electoral success  In public comments  the GOP is all but laying out a welcome mat Even Biden friends and aides remain at a loss to explain exactly what is holding up his decision In more than a dozen interviews over the past week  individuals close to the vice president described a man still wrestling with whether he and his family would be well served by campaign pressures while they continue grieving the death of Biden's son in May  Yet more than two months after Biden began seriously weighing that question  those individuals said it was unclear what could change that would push him from undecided to yes or no Still  Biden and his team are approaching their just in case preparations for a potential campaign with a new level of seriousness This week he has been placing calls to top Democratic strategists in early primary states such as Iowa  New Hampshire and South Carolina to solicit candid assessments of his chances  according to individuals familiar with the calls  Biden's team has also had detailed conversations with campaign data and analytics experts to determine how quickly he could ramp up the digital side of his campaign  the individuals said For Biden's supporters  including those backing the Draft Biden super PAC  those signals serve as the reassurance they were seeking that their enthusiasm hasn't been misplaced \"The steps that we're seeing toward a potential candidacy are definitely creating some excitement and anticipation and hope in people that this might be happening \" said Mike Cuzzi  a former Obama campaign official in New Hampshire who is supporting the pro Biden super PAC  He added that Biden's supporters were \"eager for him to make a determination \"Clinton's supporters feel the same  but for different reasons  After her widely lauded performance in Tuesday's debate  her campaign chairman told reporters it was time for Biden to make up his mind Clinton herself said in an interview with The Boston Globe that she had discussed the campaign with Biden a few months ago \"I said  'You know  Joe  this is totally up to you and your family  We were friends before  we will be friends after  whatever you decide '\" she told the newspaper Republicans  meanwhile  have been pining for a Biden campaign  in hopes that a more combative Democratic primary would weaken Clinton \"Right now there's no question Joe Biden would be the toughest candidate for Republicans to beat in the general election \" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore The lack of certainty has also put President Barack Obama in a delicate position  caught between loyalties to his vice president and his former secretary of state  \"I'm not going to comment on what Joe's doing or not doing \" Obama said Friday  describing Biden as his \"very able vice president \"Most recent polls show a hypothetical Biden candidacy running third  behind both Clinton and Sanders  with support in the high teens  Biden appears to primarily draw voters who would otherwise lean toward supporting Clinton  Surveys have shown a recent uptick in positive opinions of Biden nationally  with 85 percent of Democrats viewing him positively in a Gallup Poll this month In the letter  Kaufman offered the first clues to Biden's rationale for a run  describing an \"optimistic\" campaign that would focus on expanding middle class opportunity and protecting Obama's legacy  He also drew an implicit contrast with Clinton  who has been criticized by some as appearing calculated or overly choreographed \"I think it's fair to say  knowing him as we all do  that it won't be a scripted affair \" Kaufman said  \"After all  it's Joe \"   Associated Press writers Emily Swanson and Ken Thomas

Her numbers are dropping  Why? Because she’s untrustable ”Mrs  Clinton responded that she found Mr  McCarthy’s comments “deeply distressing ”Mr  McCarthy’s moves point to an uncomfortable problem  Many of the qualities that have led to his meteoric rise during a mere eight years in Congress may be liabilities should he be chosen to wield the speaker’s gavel  as is widely expected to happen next Thursday “His success has been his personality ” said Representative John Carter  Republican of Texas  Nonetheless  he said  “There has to be a strong hand somewhere in this because it is like herding cats over here ”In perhaps an effort to show that he can lead on tough votes  Mr  McCarthy voted Wednesday for a short term measure to keep the government’s lights on  even though the majority of his party voted against it “You do have to change up your style ” said Mike Long  a spokesman for Mr  McCarthy  “But getting everyone on the same page and all the key players in the same room  that doesn’t really change that much because you are the moderator of ideas and priorities ”Certainly no one doubts Mr  McCarthy’s dedication to his job and his fellow Republicans  “No one will outwork him ” said Mr  Griffin  now the lieutenant governor of Arkansas  “No one will do more television and radio outreach  He comes to districts  He was accessible and available  Then there were the little things  like jackets for our whip team  Those kind of details are not lost on members  They are what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary ”Mr  McCarthy  50  is from Bakersfield  a bastion of California Republicanism about 100 miles north of Los Angeles  A graduate of California State University  Bakersfield  he was active in the Young Republicans and worked as district director for Representative Bill Thomas  who became chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee  Mr  McCarthy ran for and won Mr  Thomas’s seat when Mr  Thomas retired in 2006 Despite his rapid ascent on Capitol Hill  Mr  McCarthy has continued  like a number of House conservatives  to sleep in his office and shower in the House gym  The idea is to save money and show that he has not “gone Washington ” Nonetheless  Kevin Spacey shadowed Mr  McCarthy around the Capitol to prepare for his role as Frank Underwood  the House majority whip and now president in the Netflix series “House of Cards ”In the interview on Tuesday on Fox  Mr  McCarthy spoke uncharitably about Mr  Boehner  who just a week ago he claimed to fully support  “I think John Boehner deserves a B minus ” Mr  McCarthy said in the interview  suggesting that Mr  Boehner did not listen enough to the most conservative members  as has been their complaint Curiously  Mr  McCarthy now also takes the position that he was let down by the Republican leadership when in fact he has been in the Republican leadership since Republicans took control of the House in 2011 He has adaptively shifted toward the right  an echo of political moves that Mr  McCarthy made as majority leader and before that as majority whip In 2013  as whip  he pressed Republicans to vote on a budget deal that raised taxes on affluent Americans  only to then turn and vote against it  avoiding going on record in favor of a tax increase “That really upset a lot of people ” said Representative Charlie Dent  Republican of Pennsylvania  who was on the whip team who twisted arms on Mr  McCarthy’s behalf  “I didn’t whip votes for the fiscal cliff so that leaders could vote against it ”In June 2014  just days after the then House majority leader  Eric Cantor  was defeated by a Tea Party challenger in a Republican primary  Mr  McCarthy suddenly announced that he no longer supported the existence of the federal Export Import Bank That position put Mr  McCarthy in line with Representative Jeb Hensarling  Republican of Texas  who was widely rumored to be considering a challenge to Mr  McCarthy for Mr  Cantor’s leadership post It was also out of step with many House Republicans who have employers in their districts that rely on the bank but in step with the right leaning corners of the House Mr  McCarthy is now seizing his moment at a time when conservatives in the Republican conference have been longing for a young  fresh and presumably more sympathetic ear than they had in Mr  Boehner  a seasoned lawmaker who knew the ins and outs of the House “He called me once just to say hi and I didn’t call him back because I thought he was too busy to take the call ” said Representative Adam Kinzinger  Republican of Illinois  “He saw me later in the hallway and asked why I didn’t call him back  He’s just great at building coalitions ”","headline":{"main":"Can Kevin McCarthy, House Speaker Favorite, Go From Buddy to Boss?","print_headline":"Can a Buddy in the House Become Boss?"},"wordCount":"1040"},

for the United States and 11 other Pacific nations gathered in Atlanta on Wednesday to try to reach agreement on the largest regional free trade pact ever  But knotty differences persist  and antitrade blasts from American presidential candidates have not eased prospects for any deal The talks in a downtown Atlanta hotel are picking up where ministers left off two months ago after deadlocking at a Maui resort  at odds over trade in pharmaceutical drugs  autos  sugar and dairy goods  among other matters  United States negotiators said last week that enough progress had been made in recent contacts to justify hosting another  perhaps final round For President Obama  who cited the potential agreement during his address this week to the United Nations  success in a negotiating effort as old as his administration would be a legacy achievement  The proposed Trans Pacific Partnership would liberalize trade and open markets among a dozen nations on both sides of the Pacific  from Canada to Chile and Japan to Australia  that account for about two fifths of the world’s economic output Failure would be just as big a defeat for Mr  Obama  and upset his long troubled foreign policy initiative to reorient American engagement toward fast growing Asia and away from the violent morass of the Middle East and North Africa  Yet if the Atlanta talks yield no agreement by the weekend  the Americans are unlikely to declare failure Time is not the president’s friend  however  Even if agreement is reached this week  Congress will not debate and vote on it until late winter — in the heat of the states’ presidential nominating contests — because by law Mr  Obama cannot sign the deal without giving lawmakers 90 days’ notice He will need bipartisan support  given the resistance of many Democrats and union allies to such trade accords  But presidential candidates in both parties have already registered strong opposition The Republican front runner  Donald J  Trump  the billionaire who boasts of his own deal making prowess  has called the emerging trans Pacific agreement “a disaster ” While some Republican rivals also are critical  it is the rhetoric of Mr  Trump  given his celebrity appeal  that has Republican leaders more worried that a toxic trade debate could threaten vulnerable Republicans in 2016  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  supports a Pacific accord but nonetheless wants to protect his narrow Republican majority — and deny Mr  Obama an achievement On the Democratic side  where unions  progressive groups and many members of Congress oppose an agreement  Hillary Rodham Clinton has not taken a stand  though she repeatedly promoted the Pacific accord as secretary of state  In June  Mrs  Clinton told an Iowa audience “there should be no deal” if congressional Democrats’ concerns for workers were not addressed  and many in the party  including administration officials  expect she ultimately would oppose a deal  like her rival  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont The United States trade representative  Michael B  Froman  said before heading to Atlanta  “The president has made clear that he will only accept a T P P  agreement that delivers for middle class families  supports American jobs and furthers our national security ”“The substance of the negotiations will drive the timeline for completion ” Mr  Froman added  “not the other way around ”Mr  Obama and Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who has not ruled out a bid for president  showed at the United Nations that they were pressing hard to get an agreement  The president affirmed his support in private meetings with several world leaders  according to administration officials In his address to the United Nations  Mr  Obama told foreign leaders the accord would be a model for the world  “an agreement that will open markets  while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained ” Should a deal come together  central to the White House campaign to sell the agreement to Congress would be the argument that setting economic  labor and environmental standards in the Pacific region would counter China’s influence  officials said Late Tuesday  Mr  Biden brought Mr  Froman to a Manhattan meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan  who has made an agreement central to his own economic platform The Obama administration has pressed for the Pacific accord for six years  picking up the idea from the George W  Bush administration  Many issues have been all but settled  but nothing is final until everything is decided That progress  including tentative agreements on ending tariffs  setting labor and environmental standards  and opening certain markets  has sustained the negotiations despite setbacks But several issues continue to block a deal Dairy market rules divide the United States  Canada  Australia and New Zealand  this has been especially troublesome for Canada’s team  since the nation will hold elections this month Also divisive are provisions over auto exports  including requirements that autos have a certain percentage of parts made in countries that are parties to the agreement  Japan has sought a lower percentage of parts in the “rules of origin ” with some support from Americans  to allow the export of autos with Chinese parts  while Mexico and Canada demand stricter rules Perhaps most contentious are negotiations related to protections for pharmaceutical companies’ drugs  especially cutting edge biologics that are made from living organisms and considered promising against cancer  among other ailments Several countries  especially Australia  have opposed the United States and its pharmaceutical industry for insisting that companies’ drug data be protected for 12 years to create financial incentives to innovate  Critics say this keeps lower cost generic drugs and “biosimilars” off the market for too long Here  too  the presidential contest has injected a wild card  Mrs  Clinton and Mr  Sanders each have accused drug makers of price gouging While there is talk of an eight year compromise  for many opponents that is too long  Judit Rius Sanjuan  a manager of a campaign by Doctors Without Borders to hasten access to lower priced drugs and vaccines  said she met with American negotiators last week in Washington  “and they gave me zero indication that they are going to be more flexible on this issue ”Andrew Spiegel  executive director of the Global Colon Cancer Association  said drug makers needed the incentives of strong protections for their intellectual property to encourage their research  He did not offer an answer to the question dividing negotiators  how many years the drug makers’ data monopoly should last “I leave it to them to pick the magic number ” Mr  Spiegel said Last week  156 members of Congress  mostly Democrats  wrote the administration to complain that some parties to the talks  like Vietnam  Singapore and Japan  manipulate their currency values to underprice their products  While discussions are continuing  the administration is counting on reaching a currency deal with the Asian nations that would be a side agreement to any trade pact ","headline":{"main":"Pacific Trade Deal Talks Resume, Under Fire From U.S. Presidential Hopefuls","print_headline":"Pacific

these presidential candidates sweating under the sweltering late summer sun of the Caribbean  rather than jetting to Iowa  New Hampshire and other swing states But this crowded political season is far from usual  and a combination of politics both practical  like scrapping for every delegate  and symbolic  like reaching out to a Puerto Rican constituency that is growing on the mainland  notably in Central Florida  has made Puerto Rico’s role in the nominating process of outsize import compared with years past Exhibit A  Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  and Hillary Rodham Clinton held dueling events here less than 10 miles apart on issues close to the heart of Puerto Rico  Mrs  Clinton focused on health care  Mr  Rubio on economic issues “I have been in a lot of events in the United States  but I haven’t been to an event with so much life like this one ” Mr  Rubio said in Spanish  clutching a microphone and a white towel to wipe the sweat pouring off his forehead as a D J  quickly turned back up the salsa music to allow the crowd one last sway and shake before Mr  Rubio’s stump speech He addressed a packed restaurant and bar in Santurce  a district of San Juan  almost entirely in Spanish  emphasizing his parents’ immigrant story and offering strong support for Puerto Rican statehood  should the commonwealth vote in favor of it  before heading off to catch a flight  He had spent the early morning at a  1 000 per person fund raising luncheon in San Juan A 10 minute drive down the highway  Mrs  Clinton held a round table event at the Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico y del Caribe  where she focused on the health and economic challenges facing Puerto Rico  whose government is in a financial crisis and struggling to pay  72 billion in debt After arriving an hour late  Mrs  Clinton sat and did more listening than talking at first — “I came here to listen ” she told the panel — nodding and taking notes as seven health officials and practitioners listed issues plaguing Puerto Rico’s health care system  from struggling with Affordable Care Act regulations to an exodus of talented doctors to the mainland  One of the panelists handed her a magazine  and while Mrs  Clinton recognized it was in Spanish  she said she got the message “I can read crisis and crisis ” Mrs  Clinton said  to a few laughs from the crowd The Rubio campaign billed the dueling events as a battle between him and Mrs  Clinton  blasting out a press release titled “Marco vs  Hillary in Puerto Rico this Friday” and criticizing Mrs  Clinton in his only English remarks at his event “It sounds to me like Secretary Clinton’s plan for Puerto Rico is to continue the same projects that they’re doing now ” he said in response to a question  “The people who are rallying behind her today are the people who put Puerto Rico in this fiscal mess to begin with ”Mr  Rubio also wrote an op ed article  in English and Spanish  published on Friday in El Nuevo Día  Puerto Rico’s highest circulation newspaper  that highlighted his opposition to granting Puerto Rico the right to seek a Chapter 9 bankruptcy  which Mrs  Clinton supports  His position drew challenging questions from local reporters  and Mr  Rubio reiterated that he believed Puerto Rico must reform its spending policies before it is granted relief Mrs  Clinton  however  while not mentioning Mr  Rubio or any other Republican in her speech  obviously disagreed “I do not believe you can fix your economy through austerity alone ” she said  to whoops and cheers in the crowd She did take the same position as Mr  Rubio on potential statehood  saying that should Puerto Ricans vote for it  she would stand with them The two candidates’ presence on the same day here underscored the importance of the commonwealth in the nominating process The visits by Republicans — Jeb Bush traveled here in April — reflect how the candidates are taking no delegates for granted  Just last month  Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas  dispatched a staff member 8 000 miles away to Guam to try to pick up the territory’s eight delegates For the crowded Republican contest  Puerto Rico and its roughly 23 delegates are something of a jewel  comparable to Maryland and New Hampshire on the final score sheet  And  in a wrinkle rarely relevant before this cycle  Rule 40b of the Republican Party states that a Republican candidate must win the majority of support from eight states and territories to make it to the convention For Mrs  Clinton  the visit to the commonwealth reflects both short  and long term goals  Trying to bat away the increasingly popular Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race  Mrs  Clinton is also in the delegate grabbing game But she also has an eye on the general election  Puerto Ricans are increasingly moving to Central Florida  where they are a key voting bloc in the swing state  In the past two elections  they have turned out in large numbers  helping hand President Obama his two victories in Florida And she hinted at as much as she closed her remarks in Puerto Rico “It always struck me as so indefensible that you can’t vote for president if you live here ” she said with a slight smile  “But if you move to Florida — which  of course  I’m just naming a state — you can vote for president ”","headline":{"main":"Race Pulls Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton to

N H  —  Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday that everyone involved in the investigation into her email practices as secretary of state should cooperate and insisted that she was running her campaign with joy even as questions persist around why she conducted government business on a private server Responding to reports that Bryan Pagliano  the State Department aide who set up an email system in her Chappaqua  N Y   home  plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination in response to a congressional inquiry  Mrs  Clinton told reporters after a rally here  “I would very much urge anybody who is asked to cooperate to do so ”Without mentioning Mr  Pagliano’s name  Mrs  Clinton gingerly sought to explain why she had paid him with her own money to oversee her server She referred to the “personal services” he provided  adding  “During a period of time we continued to need his technical assistance  I think that’s in the public record ”As for whether she would pay for attorney’s fees for aides pulled into the inquiries by the F B I  and a House panel investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi  Libya  Mrs  Clinton said  “I have no idea ”If Mrs  Clinton sounded terse and  on questions regarding her server  euphemistic  she claimed the monthslong controversy that has sent her popularity to career lows was not bothering her “When you run for any office it’s a very challenging experience  some days are better than other days ” she said  “But from my perspective  I really like listening to people  I like getting out and talking and figuring out what’s on people’s minds ”Hearing from voters and coming up with ways to address their challenges  Mrs  Clinton said  gets her “up in the morning ” She sounded far more upbeat discussing those very issues earlier in the day when she kicked off her “Women for Hillary” campaign in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of the women’s rights speech she gave at a United Nations conference in China Receiving the formal endorsement of Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  a longtime ally and the only woman in history to serve as both a governor and a United States senator  Mrs  Clinton recited her memorable line from Beijing “It’s worth saying again  human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights  once and forever ” said Mrs  Clinton to a crowd of about a thousand people  the majority of them women  gathered outside this seaside town’s middle school on a cloudless late summer day  She used her remarks to praise the ascent of women into positions of power in this state  where three out of four members of the congressional delegation  the governor and chief justice of the State Supreme Court are women  “I think the rest of America could learn from New Hampshire ” Mrs  Clinton said It was the latest reminder of how  unlike in her failed 2008 presidential bid  she is unambiguously highlighting her history making potential as the first female president The audience included Clinton enthusiasts dating back to Bill Clinton’s 1992 primary campaign here  many of whom were glad to see Mrs  Clinton embracing her gender  “They probably vetted it and some bunch of campaign people thought that was the way to success  and I didn’t ” said Nancy Richards Stower  an activist from Merrimack  N H   of Mrs  Clinton’s de emphasis of gender eight years ago Mrs  Clinton’s recurring stump speech is long on issues traditionally associated with female voters  and she contrasted her views on issues like abortion rights with those of the Republican presidential candidates  some of whom she mentioned by name But she made no mention of her Democratic rivals  even though Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has emerged as a threat to defeat her in this state  As for whether she would be open to additional primary debates beyond the four now scheduled to take place by the time the early nominating states are done voting  Mrs  Clinton deferred to the Democratic National Committee  which is sanctioning the forums “I am open to whatever the D N C  decides to set up ” she said Mrs  Clinton’s aides said she plans to continue her focus on attacking the Republican White House hopefuls  and would target Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin on a trip this month to Milwaukee They have become resigned to the email controversy dogging her for weeks more  and indicated that Mrs  Clinton would continue to do television interviews  as she did late last week on MSNBC  to address the issue and attempt to convey her broader message  But it was clear that the candidate herself takes little pleasure in discussing the matter of her email usage  Near the end of her news conference  when a reporter admitted that she had wanted to ask another question but felt obliged to inquire about the emails  Mrs  Clinton smiled and encouraged her to resist the impulse “Oh  come on  liberate yourself and ask the question you want to ask ” Mrs  Clinton said But the email question still came her way  as she surely knew it would She did her best  though  to demonstrate she was no less upbeat about her campaign As she walked away from the podium with Ms  Shaheen  Mrs  Clinton raised her arms and her voice  “And off we go  joyfully ” she said ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Urges Cooperation on Inquiry Into Her Emails, as She Finds Joy Elsewhere","print_headline":"Clinton Urges Cooperation

spirited challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire  Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has reminded her supporters that she will be better positioned to defeat Mr  Sanders once the primary fight moves to more racially diverse states  where polls show she has a large advantage over him among blacks and Hispanics But a late entry by Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  into the Democratic contest could complicate Mrs  Clinton’s strategy  particularly if he were able to portray himself to minority voters as President Obama’s rightful heir There may be no more consequential element to a campaign by Mr  Biden  If he were able to loosen Mrs  Clinton’s grip on nonwhite voters by the time votes are cast in South Carolina  Nevada and the Southern states holding contests on Super Tuesday  it could set off a prolonged  bruising and expensive Democratic primary season But interviews with Democratic strategists and elected officials  as well as polls of Democrats  suggest that it would not be easy for Mr  Biden to poach blacks and Hispanics from Mrs  Clinton  who  along with former President Bill Clinton  remains highly popular with those voters To do so  these Democrats say  Mr  Biden would need a measure of help — or simply luck  Mrs  Clinton would have to be seen as politically damaged for minority voters  and especially black and Hispanic women  to switch their loyalties from a potential first female president to a white man “If she acquits herself well on Oct  22 and she does well in Iowa  I don’t think Vice President Biden getting in will be a big factor ” said Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  referring to the date for Mrs  Clinton’s testimony before the House panel investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state  “But if something happens with these emails or she stumbles in Iowa  then it’s ‘Katy  bar the door ’ ”Other prominent black Democrats questioned how much harm the email controversy could cause Mrs  Clinton “Black people are used to being attacked themselves ” said Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  who said his constituents were more focused on economic opportunity and racial justice — or what he called “survival stuff ” Mr  Biden  he added  “only becomes significant if they see that she is faltering ”Polls show that Mr  Biden would probably compete for the same pool of Democratic voters as Mrs  Clinton  But he would not begin with significant support from minorities  A New York Times CBS News Poll taken last month showed Mrs  Clinton with support from 52 percent of nonwhite voters  compared with 18 percent for Mr  Biden and 17 percent for Mr  Sanders In his 2008 primary contest with Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Obama struggled at first to dislodge black voters from their attachment to her family  But once he prevailed in Iowa and blacks realized that he could be a winner  they rushed in his direction  eager to make history  In South Carolina  Mr  Obama gained a crucial upper hand by winning with a 28 point margin and crushing Mrs  Clinton among blacks Mr  Biden’s supporters in South Carolina say that the vice president has since become closely identified with Mr  Obama  “He is almost the face of the administration around here ” said the Rev  Joseph Darby  an influential African Methodist Episcopal pastor in Charleston  “The president has only made a few trips to South Carolina  but Joe is in and out all the time ”Mr  Darby said Mrs  Clinton still retained support but had failed to generate much enthusiasm  “The challenge is not just support  but energy ” he said Mrs  Clinton’s supporters question whether President Obama’s popularity is transferable to Mr  Biden  and pointedly note that Mr  Biden has a separate identity  and record “The problem Joe Biden has is that Joe Biden is not Barack Obama ” said Bakari Sellers  a former South Carolina state representative who is backing Mrs  Clinton  “We have to have a conversation about mass incarceration ” he said  “And when the vice president was senator  he was the reason so many African Americans were sent to prison  and are still there right now  for minor offenses  That’s a conversation we have to have  And I’m not sure he wants to go through that ”A spokeswoman for Mr  Biden  who insisted on anonymity to discuss campaign related questions  said Mr  Biden had believed since the 1994 crime bill’s passage — it was signed into law by President Bill Clinton — that aspects of it  “like the three strikes measure ” would not “function as their proponents intended ” Other elements  “like relief from mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent  first time drug offenders ” she said  “didn’t go as far as he would have liked to improve the then existing law and protect basic principles of fairness and justice ”In Nevada  where Mrs  Clinton dominated among Latino voters in the 2008 caucuses  Democrats say she has helped herself by aggressively organizing and by recruiting Hispanic leaders  But Mr  Biden has been a familiar face there as well  and Democratic officials there suggest that Mr  Biden would at least challenge Mrs  Clinton in minority constituencies that Mr  Sanders has so far been unable to reach “If Biden gets in  it’s going to make the decision making process more difficult for people ” said Lucy Flores  a former member of the Nevada State Assembly who is running for Congress next year  “They’ll feel like they have more options ”Mrs  Clinton’s supporters argue that her campaign has made minority voters a vital focus and that Hispanics  especially  have noticed  “They made it very clear that they understand that we’re appealing to a diverse state and that Latinos are going to play a key role here ” said Andres Ramirez  a strategist in Las Vegas  who noted that Mrs  Clinton’s first two Nevada hires were Hispanics and that she gave her first major campaign speech about immigration in the state “Ethnic outreach is often considered a secondary priority of campaigns ” Mr  Ramirez said  “but when Hillary launched her campaign  she made it a primary concern ”Democrats not committed to any candidate say that Mr  Biden faces the possibility of a window closing because of the organizational demands of the Nevada caucuses “Does he have demonstrated successes in the Obama administration? Yes ” former Representative Steven Horsford said of Mr  Biden  “But time is running out  As he takes painstaking steps to decide  others are making the necessary inroads ”","headline":{"main":"Biden Bid Could Lead to Battle for Minorities","print_headline":"Biden Bid Could Lead to Battle for Minorities"},"wordCount":"1069"},

Wednesday against President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran  Hillary Rodham Clinton embraced the agreement a short distance away  But she warned it would work only “as part of a larger strategy toward Iran” that contained Tehran’s power in the region as sanctions are lifted Mrs  Clinton’s speech  at the Brookings Institution  amounted to a strong endorsement of the deal struck by President Obama and her successor as secretary of state  John Kerry  though one laced with skepticism about Iran’s intentions “Diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection — it is the balancing of risk ” she said  arguing that the risks of walking away from a deal that she helped shape would turn the United States  not Iran  into the international outlier Her appearance created a stark juxtaposition in the presidential race as Mr  Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held a joint rally to assail the agreement  with Mr  Trump saying  “Never  ever  ever in my life have I seen any transaction as incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran ”In her appearance  Mrs  Clinton nevertheless sought to distinguish herself from the president on foreign policy  calling for a tough reassessment of American policy toward Vladimir V  Putin of Russia  and she seemed  by implication  to suggest that the Obama administration had not responded strongly enough to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing military action in Ukraine  She noted the recent reports of Russian troops in Syria and argued “we need a concerted effort to up the costs on Russia and Putin — I am in the camp that we have not done enough ”“I don’t think we can dance around it much longer ” she said  arguing that the Russians were seeking to “stymie and undermine American power whenever and wherever they can ”But most of her speech and discussion afterward was an effort to navigate a careful line between claiming credit for the Iran deal while also expressing skepticism by positioning herself as tougher than her former boss and perhaps more devoted to keeping rifts with Israel from breaking out into the open  She was clearly positioning herself as the candidate best poised to take on Iran’s challenge and influence in the Middle East “Distrust and verify” would be her approach  she insisted  turning Ronald Reagan’s “trust but verify” line about the Soviet Union on its head  She went on to describe Iran as a “ruthless  brutal regime ” words far harsher than Mr  Obama has used as he has sought to coax the Iranians along in the years of perilous diplomacy  She added  “I will not hesitate to take military action” if Iran seeks to obtain a nuclear bomb despite its commitments  a deliberately stronger formulation than Mr  Obama’s “all options are on the table ”She also took shots at former Vice President Dick Cheney  who spoke against the deal on Tuesday  reminding her audience of invited guests that the Iranian nuclear program surged ahead during the Bush administration But she knew that an endorsement without an explanation of how she would counter Iran would leave many in her Democratic base dissatisfied  so Mrs  Clinton took several opportunities to draw contrasts between her approach to Middle East policy and that of the administration she left 32 months ago  She reiterated her call to arm moderate Syrian rebels  a case she and David Petraeus made when she was secretary of state and he was director of the C I A   and she criticized her own record when she said that she and the administration did do enough to support the 2009 uprising in Iran Mrs  Clinton’s promise that her approach to the Iranians would be to “confront them across the board” appeared part of an effort to answer one of the chief criticisms of the deal  that the resumed flow of oil revenue into Iran will help it fund proxies like Hezbollah and embolden the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps to conduct what Mrs  Clinton described as “cyberattacks or other nontraditional attacks ” So  she said  the deal must be the starting point of a new American containment strategy A crucial part of that strategy  as she described it  would be a stepped up effort to contain Iran’s military activity in Syria and around the Middle East  and new restrictions on conventional arms to Iran   She did not mention one of Mr  Kerry’s last concessions  made in July during talks in Vienna  that included the expiration  over eight years  of United Nations embargoes on missile and other conventional arms sales  But while she described what amounts to an effort to impose sanctions on Iranian banks and organizations that support terror groups — even as other sanctions linked to nuclear activity are being lifted — she followed a careful path  For example  while she promised to sell F 35 fighter jets and missile defenses to Israel  she said nothing about selling the Israelis the United States’ most powerful bunker busting bomb  the “Massive Ordnance Penetrator ” Israel has pressed for the weapon because it is the only one that can get into Iran’s deep underground sites  but it would also need America’s giant B 2 bomber to drop it Nonetheless  with some of her strongest support coming from American Jews who are skeptical of the deal and its effect on Israel  Mrs  Clinton went further than Mr  Obama in reassuring them  She said she would invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to the White House in her first month in office — a contrast to Mr  Obama who did not visit Israel in his first term  “Israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction ” Mrs  Clinton said of Iran Unlike Mr  Obama’s speech at American University in July  part of his effort to sell the deal  Mrs  Clinton’s talk on Wednesday worked from the assumption that Iran will try to violate the deal  “We need to be prepared for three scenarios ” she said  “First  Iran tries to cheat ” The second  she said  was that the Iranians would seek to “wait us out” until the world is distracted  and then resume their efforts to enrich uranium  produce plutonium or develop a weapon And the third was that Iran would seek to flex its muscles abroad  “We shouldn’t expect that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior ” she said ","headline":{"main":"Hillary Clinton Backs Iran Nuclear Deal, With Caveats","print_headline":"In Endorsing Iran Nuclear Deal,

Marco Rubio traveled on Friday to eastern Ohio  with its vast underground natural gas deposits  and laid out an energy policy that would rely on drilling and hydraulic fracturing and roll back many of the most aggressive components of President Obama’s environmental agenda Mr  Rubio said he would immediately allow construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline to go forward  which Mr  Obama has yet to commit to  Mr  Rubio would also permit more offshore oil and gas drilling  which the president has already expanded  and effectively nullify an international climate change accord the administration is pursuing And he vowed to reverse Environmental Protection Agency regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and hydraulic fracturing  known as fracking  to allow the extraction of gas buried deep in the ground near places like Salem Taking issue with what he described as a Democratic “fear campaign” against fracking  he said that the hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of natural gas and oil underneath the ground “are doing the people of Ohio no good pent up in shale rock ”If his words left any doubt about the intended beneficiaries of his energy plan  the setting he chose spoke volumes  a company that makes equipment used to drill and refine fossil fuels  BOC Water Hydraulics Mr  Rubio’s speech emphasized extracting natural resources from the ground  as opposed to investing in less polluting options like wind or solar power  and struck a combative tone  He promised the crowd of about 300 that there would be major differences in how a Rubio administration would balance energy policy with environmental protection and how a Democratic White House would “It is innovation  not regulation  that will prompt the development of affordable fuel alternatives ” he said  “That is why conservatives  not liberals  have the more sustainable energy agenda ”To emphasize his point  he reached for a religious reference  He said that the Obama administration had issued nearly 30 000 pages of new regulations  which he noted was “about 46 times the length of the Bible ”And he named Hillary Rodham Clinton one of the biggest impediments to growth in the energy industry “This is what I mean when I say Democrats like Hillary Clinton are outdated ” he said  “They label themselves ‘progressives ’ yet take great pride in opposing economic progress ”Mr  Rubio shares his Republican rivals’ distaste for Mr  Obama’s efforts to negotiate an international accord to combat climate change  And his plan appears explicitly intended to weaken the president’s hand as Mr  Obama tries to reach an agreement with other United Nations members at a climate conference in Paris in December While Mr  Obama hopes that such a deal will be a cornerstone of his legacy  the ultimate success of the accord hinges on whether his successor will actually carry it out — and Mr  Rubio’s plan makes clear that a President Rubio would not do so  In fact  his plan would require congressional ratification of any international climate agreements  something highly unlikely in the current Republican led Congress In the absence of support from Congress  Mr  Obama has relied on new E P A rules to push his environmental agenda  In August  he unveiled his most ambitious and contentious regulations to date  a set of limits on planet warming carbon emissions from coal fired power plants  If enacted  the rules could close hundreds of coal plants in the United States  lower domestic demand for coal and transform the nation’s electricity system to rely more heavily on renewable sources of energy Less noticeable in Mr  Rubio’s speech was the political subtext  Ohio does not hold one of the early presidential nominating contests  as Iowa and New Hampshire do  But it is home to one of Mr  Rubio’s rivals for the Republican presidential nomination  Gov  John Kasich  Mr  Rubio has now visited Ohio  which Republicans will almost certainly have to carry in 2016 to win the White House  several times since August for fund raising events and campaign rallies His speech was also certain to please the energy sector executives who pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Republican political campaigns  Environmental groups scoffed at the proposals  saying Mr  Rubio’s plan could have been written by the industry itself “Senator Rubio’s energy policies may impress the Koch brothers ” said Denis Dison  communications director for the NRDC Action Fund  “But American voters are growing tired of his kind of slavish devotion to old  dirty energy sources that threaten our kids’ futures ”In contrast to how environmental concerns have dominated the Democratic nominating contest  Republicans almost never mention the subject  and when they do  it is often to diminish or dismiss the threat of global warming  Mr  Rubio’s speech was no different  It did not mention the term “climate change” once  In fact  he mocked Democrats for being obsessed with it “If we elect Hillary Clinton as president ” he said  “an outdated leader who believes President Obama’s restrictions haven’t gone far enough  who believes that energy policy is more about trying to change the weather than it is about empowering our people — then we will miss out on one of the greatest economic opportunities of this century ”Mrs  Clinton has pledged  if elected  to fully carry out and expand on Mr  Obama’s climate change regulations ","headline":{"main":"Marco Rubio’s Energy Policy Centers on Drilling and Reversing Obama Rules","print_headline":"Rubio Comes Out Strong for Drilling

DeGeneres Show” secured the lineup for its fall premiere week  the executive producers were clearly delighted to land an interview with a guest who has become one of the most talked about and hotly debated women in the country They also booked Hillary Rodham Clinton Mrs  Clinton will appear on Ms  DeGeneres’s show two days after Caitlyn Jenner  a former Olympic champion who is transgender Typically  an appearance by Mrs  Clinton on a national television show — “Ellen” will be her fifth interview since she declared her candidacy in April — would earn top billing  but “Ellen” is not like other shows  Its warmhearted approach and enormous reach among women make it one of the most sought after interviews for politicians Mrs  Clinton’s aides had long been eager for her to do an interview with Ms  DeGeneres this fall  when voters are paying attention to the election  believing it could humanize her beyond policy speeches and political attacks As it turns out  the episode  taped Tuesday in front of an audience at Rockefeller Center in New York and scheduled to be broadcast Thursday  could not come at a more opportune moment  Mrs  Clinton is facing an uphill battle to connect with voters  and women  in particular  who recent polls show have been turned off by her use of a private email server while secretary of state and an increasing sense that she cannot relate to them An ABC News Washington Post poll released last week showed that 51 percent of women had an unfavorable view of Mrs  Clinton  an increase of 11 percentage points since July  with a particular decline among white women In the fractured media landscape  few TV shows deliver the reach of “Ellen ” with nearly 55 million adults watching all or part of the show on television or online last year  according to Nielsen  Episodes last season averaged 3 4 million viewers  of whom 73 percent were women who do not typically watch the Sunday morning news programs and can be difficult for elected officials to reach “Women have been hearing a lot of unfavorable stuff about emails and the Clintons being secretive ” said Susan J  Carroll  a professor of political science and women’s and gender studies at Rutgers  Mrs  Clinton  Professor Carroll said  “needs to rebuild trust and show people that she is a real person  in a sense ”Ms  DeGeneres — who will also interview Malala Yousafzai  a young Nobel Peace Prize recipient  between her sit downs with Ms  Jenner and Mrs  Clinton — can help do that Ms  DeGeneres can be wacky and unpredictable with guests  but never meanspirited  her executive producers said in interviews  During Tuesday’s taping  she asked Mrs  Clinton what she thought of Kanye West running for president in 2020  “I would only ask him if I’m running for re election to wait ” she replied  and had a 5 year old presidential history buff quiz the former first lady  among other antics “For a candidate  shows like ‘Ellen’ can be particularly useful in times when you’re getting a bad ride in the traditional press ” said Dan Pfeiffer  a longtime aide to President Obama  Mr  Obama has appeared on “Ellen” four times  including dancing his way onto the stage to Beyoncé’s “Crazy in Love” in 2007 In a 2008 interview with Mrs  Clinton  the comedian flashed an image of the former first lady’s head transposed on Madonna’s body  “I want to know where you got that picture ” Mrs  Clinton said  “We have kept that picture under lock and key in this campaign ” Ms  DeGeneres quickly retorted  “I had that at home ”When Michelle Obama was facing pushback from the food industry in 2012 for her efforts to combat childhood obesity  Ms  DeGeneres invited her to a push up contest  a segment that nearly three million people shared on Twitter “She looks for ways to let a candidate really let their personality and their quirks out ” Kristina Schake  a former aide to Mrs  Obama and currently the deputy communications director to Mrs  Clinton’s campaign  said of Ms  DeGeneres Ms  Schake said Ms  DeGeneres’s interview was an important part of a broader media plan this fall  including a range of online and nontraditional outlets  “You’ll see Hillary doing lots of these kinds of venues so that Americans can get to know her not just as a woman behind a podium ” she said The show’s executive producers said the goal was not to talk about the same things news media discuss  “Ellen doesn’t put people into uncomfortable situations ” said Ed Glavin  an executive producer on the show  “You can just be silly here ”That does not mean it is an easy appearance  Mr  Pfeiffer said late night and daytime shows were among the most difficult interviews to prepare for because it was hard to predict what would come up The “Ellen” producers had brainstormed ideas with Mrs  Clinton’s camp  including blowing up on screen some of the funnier emails released by the State Department  and allowed Mrs  Clinton to talk about her policies  especially those that affect women  like equal pay  Before the taping  Mary Connelly  an executive producer for the show  said  “I would not expect Hillary Clinton to dance ” But during a commercial break  Mrs  Clinton  onstage with the singer Pink and the comedian Amy Schumer  clapped her hands and swayed her hips  swept up in the silliness of “Ellen ”","headline":{"main":"Ellen DeGeneres Interview Offers Hillary Clinton Chance to Connect

Fire Fighters  one of the country’s more politically powerful unions  has abandoned its initial plans to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton for president  according to union sources Harold A  Schaitberger  the union’s general president  informed Mrs  Clinton’s campaign manager  Robby Mook  in a telephone call on Monday  According to a union official  Mr  Schaitberger told Mr  Mook that the executive board and rank and file members — the latter were recently polled — did not support a Clinton endorsement The early support of a cross section of unions — most prominently the American Federation of Teachers  which endorsed Mrs  Clinton in July — had been a source of strength for the Clinton campaign  But in recent weeks  as Mrs  Clinton’s numbers in some polls have sagged and she has faced an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  some labor unions appear to have had second thoughts The impetus for Mr  Schaitberger’s call to Mr  Mook were conversations about the endorsement at the board’s meetings in mid September  when board members expressed interest in the possibility that Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  would join the Democratic field “Secretary Clinton doesn’t sell well here ” said Roy L  McGhee III  better known as Sandy McGhee  an I A F F  board member who represents Texas and Oklahoma  “I think the Republican attack machine  the media machine  has made sure of that  The vice president will do better  He’s popular among firefighters ”A spokesman for the Clinton campaign said that as with the campaign’s discussions with other unions  an I A F F  endorsement was never guaranteed Mr  Schaitberger worried that a Clinton endorsement could deeply divide the firefighters  according to a union official who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the endorsement decision  Members tilt Republican  but the union typically endorses Democrats for president because of their stances on labor and other issues of importance to firefighters  Union officials have cited Mr  Biden’s decades long record of leadership on these issues In a sign of how important labor support is  the Clinton campaign regularly promotes endorsements from unions like the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America and the United Union of Roofers  Waterproofers and Allied Workers  Seven national unions  representing four million working families  have endorsed Mrs  Clinton  her campaign said “When unions are strong  families are strong — and when families are strong  America is strong ” she often says But two major unions  the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  have said they will hold off on an endorsement until they have completed the process of consulting with their members  Union leaders have said the decision has as much to do with Mr  Sanders as with Mr  Biden’s looming decision about whether to enter the race Against this backdrop  the possibility of losing formal support from the firefighters comes as a particularly unwelcome blow The Clinton campaign had been in touch with the union about the possibility of an endorsement during the first several months of 2015  But the talks became serious in June  when Mr  Schaitberger  with the assent of his board  told the campaign the union was strongly leaning toward endorsing Mrs  Clinton  pending the board’s formal vote The two sides later began working out details of the endorsement that Mr  Schaitberger and his board had viewed as nearly inevitable  including discussions about the timing and location of an announcement  The most recent plans would have had Mr  Schaitberger endorse Mrs  Clinton this month in Iowa In late July  senior union officials traveled to Mrs  Clinton’s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to meet with several of her political and policy aides  The meetings took place under the assumption that the endorsement was on track  according to the union official  Their purpose was to educate the campaign about the policies that union members would want to see Mrs  Clinton discuss  and the rhetoric they would want her to use when discussing them In the evening  the I A F F  officials dined with senior Clinton campaign aides at a Brooklyn restaurant But the clear discomfort of the union’s membership with Mrs  Clinton  as well as Mr  Biden’s possible candidacy  made the endorsement increasingly untenable As Mr  Biden contemplates a run  organized labor represents one of the main Democratic constituencies he and Mrs  Clinton would fight over most intensely  Mr  Biden has been courting union officials  including the A F L  C I O  president  Richard L  Trumka  and the service employees union leader  Mary Kay Henry  Mr  Biden recounted his conversations with labor leaders to one Democratic official last month  saying they had told him they were not sure Mrs  Clinton could win  according to the official The firefighters’ union  though it claims only about 300 000 members — far fewer than the teachers’  service employees’ and municipal employees’ unions  each with more than a million members — has a history of exerting outsize political influence  thanks in part to the esteem in which the public holds firefighters The union  which endorsed the presidential campaign of Secretary of State John Kerry in September 2003  is credited by many with having helped resurrect his campaign in Iowa  where his victory in the state’s 2004 caucuses propelled him to the Democratic nomination  In 2011  the union was critical to a no vote in a referendum that overturned legislation restricting collective bargaining rights for public employees in Ohio  Other political moves have proved less effective  The union’s pick in the 2008 Democratic presidential contest  Senator Christopher J  Dodd  of Connecticut  withdrew after barely registering in the Iowa caucuses  An I A F F  spokesman said the union had hoped to keep its endorsement process private and had no intention of embarrassing Mrs  Clinton or her campaign  If Mrs  Clinton were to win the Democratic nomination  the union would most likely endorse her for the general election  according to the official ","headline":{"main":"Firefighters’ Union Backs Away From Endorsement of Hillary

is out of Fox News’s Republican debate on Thursday night in Cleveland  officials with the network said Tuesday  resolving the mystery of which lower polling candidates would make the cut for the first debate of the 2016 presidential contest The network announced the 10 candidates who will have a podium spot for the main forum  which is expected to draw wide national viewership and give an invaluable platform to the candidates involved  The remaining seven will be part of an earlier forum airing at 5 p m  that day Fox News’s “decision desk ” which does its election night calls  sifted through five national polls  including the network’s own survey released late Monday  to select the top 10 candidates for the debate based on the polling The others included in the lineup are Donald J  Trump  former Gov  Jeb Bush of Florida  Gov  Scott Walker of Wisconsin  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky  Ben Carson  former Gov  Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Gov  Chris Christie of New Jersey The process has been fraught with complaints  but driven by the reality of dealing with a candidate field far bigger than was ever anticipated  The current rules  however  mean that a sitting governor  Bobby Jindal of Louisiana  and a sitting senator  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  will be relegated to the second tier event There were few options for how Fox News  which was awarded the first official Republican debate after a process worked out by the Republican National Committee  could navigate such a sprawling field  The network and Facebook are hosting the events The number of Republicans running vastly exceeds that of other recent election cycles  a reflection of the prospect of capturing the White House without a Republican incumbent and also a belief for many that there is no strong candidate in the field keeping them out In a Bloomberg News poll this week of registered voters who identify as Republicans  about 71 percent of those surveyed approved of how Fox News has handled the debates  And an early state forum that aired on C Span on Monday night  with 14 of the candidates  highlighted how unwieldy the process is A memo from the network’s decision desk said the polls it used were all nationally recognized nonpartisan surveys “Each poll has a different margin of error  and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance ” the memo said  “Given the over 2 400 interviews contained within the five polls  from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90 percent likely that the 10th place Kasich is ahead of the 11th place Perry ”But some critics said that the national polls used to select the debate participants had too small a sample size  with too wide a margin of error  to adequately assess a candidate’s standing “I don’t know why they didn’t just do one large poll of primary voters ” said Matthew Dowd  a former adviser to President George W  Bush “This has been one of the best quality fields we’ve seen in a long time — it’s just an amazing field ” said David Winston  a top Republican pollster who worked for Newt Gingrich in the 2012 presidential race Of those who did not make the prime time debate  he said  “these are quality candidates who have earned the right to be involved in a presidential debate ”There should have been a way to accommodate sitting senators and governors with records of accomplishment  Mr  Winston said  “I understand that having that many candidates is a challenge and it’s a problem they should have figured out a way to resolve ” he said Allies of some candidates who were spurned are turning their attention to the early nominating states “The debate’s gotten disproportionate attention — the real race is happening in Iowa and New Hampshire ” said Brad Todd  an adviser to the “super PAC” backing Mr  Jindal  who has drawn large crowds in Iowa Mr  Todd said his group planned to air a 60 second ad in Iowa during the debate  one that criticizes the forum taking place in Cleveland “The donor class will not pick the nominee  nor will the establishment in Washington  nor a cable network ” Mr  Todd said  “I think it could have been done better for all concerned ”Aides to Mr  Perry sounded a note of high mindedness about it all  after weeks of some frustrations over the process The former Texas governor is “going to have a very thoughtful conversation about the country and what he thinks ought to be done for the opportunity for this country ” said Jeff Miller  an adviser to Mr  Perry And there are certain upsides  he said  “There’s a good chance that 9 p m  debate stage is going to be turned into a circus ”","headline":{"main":"John Kasich Is In, Rick Perry Is Out in First Republican

Probably not  As previous gaffe a matics have shown  it pays to be crazy  And for many Republicans  crazy is the new mainstream In Texas  the elected Republican governor  Greg Abbott  is not quite sure if simulated military maneuvers planned for his state are routine exercises by our men and women in uniform  or a plot to take everyone’s guns and enforce martial law  He’s ordered the state guard to monitor his own government’s soldiers — just in case  Oh  and Walmart is involved as well  Something about tunnels beneath abandoned stores There is no ceiling for crazy in Texas  nor political consequence  This year  the Lone Star State’s most odious export is Senator Ted Cruz  who also has some concern about the nefarious designs of our military  and those Walmart tunnels  He couldn’t just say  as the Pentagon did  that our troops would soon be conducting a long planned field operation  called Jade Helm 15  He had to dog whistle to the mouth frothers “I understand a lot of the concerns raised by a lot of citizens about Jade Helm ” said Cruz  “It’s a question I’m getting a lot  and I think part of the reason is we have seen  for six years  a federal government disrespecting the liberty of citizens ” Dwight Eisenhower — look him up  Texans — is rolling over in his five star grave If you don’t think the inability to distinguish a military exercise from a totalitarian takeover disqualifies you from leading the free world  Fox News has a hosting chair for you in its studios  That’s where Mike Huckabee promoted his brand of Gomer Pyle politics over the last few years  building a following for quack health remedies and Christian victimhood Since moving out of the Fox nursing home  he’s gone ever deeper and darker  all while traveling by private jet and building a palace in Florida  He suggested that military recruits should wait until President Obama leaves office before joining the service  He said asking a Christian to accept same sex marriage was like “asking someone who’s Jewish to start serving bacon wrapped shrimp in his deli ”Huckabee  an ordained Baptist minister who learned his shtick on the traveling preacher circuit  has become an outright theocrat  attacking the constitutional foundation against state sanctioned religion “You’ve got to understand  this for me is not about the right side or the wrong side of history ” he said last year  regarding same sex marriage  “This is the right side of the Bible ”Ben Carson  like Huckabee  sees the secular world through Scripture  He makes much of his standing as a Seventh day Adventist  those nice people who show up at your door with pamphlets  prompting little kids to ask their parents  “What’s a Seventh day Dentist?”But the Adventists  to their credit  are distancing themselves from Carson  Following his presidential announcement  the church released a statement warning officials that the pulpit should remain neutral in politics  based on “our historical position of separation of church and state ”For those of you keeping score  in the last week Republicans have gained two people whose political philosophy could find a home among Iran’s governing ayatollahs  and a failed chief executive who thinks driving a great company into the ground is a good business model  All are featured prominently in conservative media What this shows is that  if you’re on television long enough  you start to think you’d make a good president  Or perhaps it just shows that if you run for president as a Republican  you can ensure that you’ll be on television long enough  Either way  one enforces the other  and ultimately influences the nominee  And that’s when the rest of us start paying attention ","headline":{"main":"Fringe Festival","content_kicker":"Contributing Op-Ed Writer","kicker":"Op-Ed | Timothy Egan","print_headline":"Fringe Festival"},"wordCount":"917"},

the sin of over explanation  answering a pithy 1994 attack on his business career with so many details about leases and debts that a baffled crowd erupted into boos He has delivered high minded put downs  promising in a 1998 face off to establish a charter school “for people that distort the facts” and mischievously guaranteeing admission to his opponent And he has mangled seemingly simple sentences  vowing in a 2002 confrontation that “we can make Florida a bright — have a brighter future for — for all Floridians ”In a Republican presidential debate season dominated by glib showmanship and volcanic personality  Mr  Bush  the former governor of Florida  faces a daunting challenge  How can he excite primary voters during Wednesday’s televised rumpus with a sober and cerebral style that can appear tepid next to the insult spraying  nuance avoidant  made for TV manner of Donald J  Trump?Now  after failing to directly confront Mr  Trump  the current front runner  during the first debate  Mr  Bush and his aides are under pressure to create a memorable showdown with the real estate developer to match a newly aggressive tone on the campaign trail Since the first debate  Mr  Bush has mocked Mr  Trump’s immigration plan as “unrealistic ” released a biting  online ad that captures Mr  Trump praising Hillary Rodham Clinton and accused Mr  Trump of trying to “insult his way to the presidency ”In rigorous practice sessions that have crisscrossed the country in the past few weeks  Mr  Bush has been preparing pointed responses to Mr  Trump’s most frequent insults  he has called Mr  Bush “low energy” and a slave to donors  and crafting lines of attack on Mr  Trump’s history of liberal statements and unconventional policy plans  according to those who have been told of the plans “He has to challenge Trump now ” said Mac Stipanovich  an adviser to Mr  Bush during his 1994 campaign for governor who helped prepare him for debates that year  “He has to stand toe to toe with him and call him out ”The difficulty for Mr  Bush  who has portrayed himself as the most mature and civil figure in the Republican presidential field  is how to inflict damage on Mr  Trump in front of a live national audience without diminishing himself in the process — a tricky task given Mr  Trump’s lust for the fierce counterpunch and Mr  Bush’s disdain for memorizing sound bites “Jeb is a nice man  He likes people  He wants people to like him ” said Newt Gingrich  the former House speaker  who dominated several Republican debates during the 2012 presidential campaign  “He is up against a barroom brawler  And I think against barroom brawlers  if you are a nice man  you are better off keeping your distance ”Interviews with current and former advisers to Mr  Bush and reviews of video footage from his debates as a candidate for governor reveal him to be a debater with as many deficits as strengths  On stage  his mastery of policy is almost unrivaled  but he struggles to synthesize it in compelling ways  He is capable of telegraphing deep compassion in one moment  but can convey unmistakable peevishness in the next  He defaults to analytical earnestness  rarely offering flashes of humor For better or worse  advisers acknowledge  his brand is self seriousness “His style ” said Sally Bradshaw  a top Bush campaign adviser  “is substance ”“His candidacy ” she added  “is not based on theatrics ”Theatrics have failed Mr  Bush at times  During a dramatic 1994 exchange in Tampa  he dared the sitting governor of Florida  Lawton Chiles  to look into the eyes of Mr  Bush’s business partner  who sat a few feet away in the audience  and repeat an attack on the two men’s ethics “I know you don’t respect me  but I know you respect Armando Codina ” Mr  Bush said  “Can you look him in the eye and say that we’ve done anything wrong?”Mr  Chiles  deploying his Southern drawl and a gift for outmaneuvering opponents  looked toward Mr  Codina  smiled and reflected on the businessman’s wisdom in hiring the son of an American president “I think ” Mr  Chiles declared  “he made a good business decision when he took you on as a partner ”The audience broke into loud laughter  A few days later  Mr  Bush lost the election Mr  Bush has participated in about a dozen official debates since first running for public office that year  The majority of those encounters have been one on one with Democratic rivals  lacking the unpredictability of a crowded stage  like Wednesday night’s forum  After losing the 1994 election to Mr  Chiles  he prevailed in the 1998 governor’s race against Buddy MacKay  Mr  Chiles’s lieutenant governor  and in his 2002 re election race against Bill McBride  a lawyer In many ways  Mr  Bush’s general election debates against Mr  MacKay are a model for how he might treat Mr  Trump in the long term  Mr  MacKay set aside his usual regal bearing and relentlessly attacked Mr  Bush as an inexperienced  untrustworthy child of privilege  Mr  Bush’s strategy was simple  deftly defend himself  sow doubts about his rival  but avoid excessive confrontation to magnify Mr  MacKay’s smoldering temper In a 1998 debate  when he was asked about his business dealing with a Nigerian corporation  Mr  Bush pivoted to discuss a controversial investment that had earned Mr  MacKay  500 000  But instead of mocking it  he suggested  generously  that there was nothing scandalous about the profit “I’m happy that the MacKay family made half a million bucks on a good investment ” Mr  Bush said  “I don’t see anything wrong with that  I applaud you for doing that ”Mr  MacKay looked slightly dazed Seventeen years later  Mr  MacKay said he had miscalculated  “I expected him to be more negative than he was ” he said in an interview last week  “I may have been too negative myself  as a matter of fact ”In the same debate  Mr  Bush showed unexpected humility when asked about his relationship with Florida’s black voters  who had flocked to his opponent four years earlier  “Republicans have ignored the black vote in this state  and I was part of that  and it was a mistake ” Mr  Bush said His tendency to cram as much information as possible into an answer has diminished since 1994  when he became entangled in a long winded explanation of a real estate transaction  He described a maze of leases “we had to assume ” a debt “borrowed by an investor in the deal” and “specific obligations ”But the habit resurfaces now and then “His mind rebels against the oversimplification that passes for succinctness in the television debate ” said Mr  Stipanovich  the 1994 adviser  “Instinctively he finds it incomplete and unsatisfying  So he over answers ”As Mr  Bush prepares for a televised brawl with Mr  Trump  that 1994 debate against the wily Mr  Chiles looms larger than ever  a searing lesson about the dangers of taking on an unpredictable opponent Midway through that face off  which seemed like an agonizing draw  Mr  Bush  the newcomer  suggested that Mr  Chiles  the incumbent  had lied to “strike fear in the hearts of the voters ”Mr  Chiles stood silently  resting an elbow on the lectern and taking it all in  Then  peering over at Mr  Bush and jabbing his finger  Mr  Chiles delivered an unscripted line about himself that changed the course of the campaign “I want to call attention to this old  liberal liar ” Mr  Chiles said self mockingly  pausing for effect  “The old he coon walks just before the light of day ”The camera captured a seemingly baffled Mr  Bush looking around the room and then toward the moderator  NBC’s Tim Russert  Neither candidate’s aides had any idea what Mr  Chiles meant  But across the state  an entire generation of native Floridians understood The he coon is the oldest and wisest member of a raccoon pack  a cunning hunter who knows exactly when to strike  Mr  Chiles used the old Southernism to make it clear  He was not done being governor yet “Jeb was speechless ” Mr  Stipanovich recalled  “He didn’t know how to respond ”“At that moment ” he said  “Lawton Chiles defeated Jeb Bush ”","headline":{"main":"Jeb Bush’s Cerebral Debate Style Faces a Test:

{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/upshot/donald-trump-moderate-republican.html","date":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","content":"Donald Trump may be the “post policy candidate ” but when you strip away the bluster and the outrageous commentary that have defined his campaign to find his occasional  substantive statements about public policy  a surprising fact emerges  Mr  Trump is a moderate Republican I realize this sounds like an odd claim  but stay with me for a bit  First you must keep in mind the Republican party context in which Mr  Trump is running At a 2011 debate  every Republican candidate for president vowed to reject any deal that exchanged  10 in spending cuts for a dollar in tax increases  Republicans in Congress have flirted with the debt limit and shut down the government in  failed  efforts to push their fiscal prescriptions through a divided government  rather than compromise  Grover Norquist  who has persuaded a large majority of Republicans in Congress to sign a pledge never to raise taxes  has cited a conservative line  “bipartisanship is another name for date rape ”Mr  Trump is anything but ideologically rigid  and he certainly does not equate deal making with surrender  let alone rape  So far  he hasn’t signed Mr  Norquist’s tax pledge “When you’re dealing  and that’s what I am  I’m a dealer ” he told my colleague Jeremy Peters  last week  “you don’t go in with plans  You go in with a certain flexibility  And you sort of wheel and deal ”Instead of promoting his ideological purity  he notes that policy choices are circumstance specific  For example  he’s not a priori opposed to single payer health care  “It works in Canada ” he said at the first Republican presidential debate on Aug  6  “It works incredibly well in Scotland ” Even in the United States  “it could have worked in a different age ” but it wouldn’t work very well right now  he said  So instead  he’d replace Obamacare with “something terrific ” which would take care of people who can’t afford health insurance Mr  Trump’s policy flexibility extends even to the core Republican issue of taxes  He has not proposed a tantalizingly low top income tax rate  like Rand Paul’s 14 5 percent or Ben Carson’s 10 percent  In fact  his vague tax position almost exactly copies Jeb Bush’s “You have to simplify this tax code ” Mr  Trump said on Fox News on Tuesday  “and from that point on you can maybe do something else  but before we do anything  simplify it  make it nice and easy for people to understand  and reduce taxes ” Compare this to what Mr  Bush said in May  “Simplifying the code  eliminating as many tax expenditures  tax deductions  tax credits as possible and lowering the rates has got to be a huge priority ”The main way Mr  Trump stands out from the field on economic policy is leftward  While most Republicans favor free trade  Mr  Trump has called for much higher tariffs on imported goods to protect American industries from competition  He has also criticized his opponents for proposing cuts in Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid  “I’m gonna make us so rich you don’t have to do those things ” Mr  Trump said in April Mr  Trump’s moderation extends to social issues  He says he “absolutely” favors rape and incest exceptions to abortion bans  which Mr  Rubio and Scott Walker oppose  He attacked Mr  Bush for saying the government perhaps need not spend so much on women’s health And on foreign policy  Mr  Trump says he would “knock the hell out” of ISIS  but he also highlights his opposition since 2004 to the Iraq war  a year after it started Mr  Trump’s signature campaign issue  immigration  is the one where he most clearly seems to stand out as a nonmoderate  The immigration plan he released Sunday calls for abolishing birthright citizenship — a policy change that would require amending the Constitution — and strong arm tactics to pressure the Mexican government into financing border enforcement He has also repeatedly said all illegal immigrants should be deported but that families should not be broken up — an apparent contradiction  since millions of American citizen children have parents who are unauthorized immigrants Still  Mr  Trump’s view is not necessarily extreme relative to an electorate that itself manages to hold often contradictory views on immigration “It’s a difficult issue to say ‘this is how the public feels ’” said Deborah Schildkraut  a professor of political science at Tufts University who studies public opinion on the issue  “People are very ambivalent ” She noted that some enforcement measures Mr  Trump has championed  such as e verify and increased border patrol staffing  are very popular  at the same time that pro immigrant measures like the Dream Act are popular Mr  Trump reflects that ambivalence himself  When Dana Bash of CNN asked him last month whether he favored a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants  he gave a more flexible answer than you might expect  given his past comments about Mexican rapists  “Right now  no ” he said  but also  “we’ll see  later  down the line  who knows what’s going to happen ” For now  he wants an “expedited” way to offer legal residency  but not citizenship  to the subset of unauthorized immigrants he considers “the good ones ”“For many Americans  the distinction between immigration writ large and unauthorized or illegal or undocumented immigration is a really key distinction ” said Dan Hopkins  a professor of government at Georgetown University  This may explain why Mr  Trump’s harsh language about illegal immigrants  which has horrified much of the news media  did not seem to harm his standing in the polls — his combination of alarmism and openness on immigration may be incoherent  but a lot of voters are conflicted on the topic  too Mr  Trump is offering an unusual mixture of extreme language  moderate policy and rudeness  and so far it’s connecting with Republican voters  Over the next few months  as voters learn more about Mr  Trump’s policy views  we’ll get to see which part of that combination is helping him soar  and whether his policy moderation and flexibility are liabilities Mr  Trump’s critique of government differs greatly from that of most conservatives  The conservative argument for small government ordinarily rests on the idea that citizens necessarily know better what to do with their money and their lives than the government does  because the government lacks the local knowledge that individuals have  Under this theory  even a government run by smart people will do lots of stupid  costly things Mr  Trump is positing not a general  inherent failure of government but a very specific one  He nearly shouted it at the recent debate  “Our leaders are stupid  our politicians are stupid ” This is the core idea of the Trump campaign  and it does not necessarily imply that government should be smaller  It implies that somebody smart  ideally Mr  Trump  should run the government If Republican voters share Mr  Trump’s diagnosis that the main problem with our government is stupid leaders  and if they believe that Mr  Trump is much smarter and wiser than the politicians who have come before him  they may be fully prepared to forgive his apostasies on Medicaid  taxes and everything else  If their real beef is not with our leaders but with big government itself  his support should fade as his policy moderation becomes clear ","headline":{"main":"Donald Trump, Moderate Republican","content_kicker":"The Road to 2016","kicker":"The

You teach them to rethink their own identity  “Our end goal is not a Christian America  either of the made up past or the hoped for future ” Dr  Moore writes in “Onward ” his manifesto for the moral minority  “Our end goal is the kingdom of Christ ” He and his allies are trying to persuade evangelicals that the Gospel thrives when being a Christian is a difficult  countercultural position These leaders are rejecting the aggressive style and narrow agenda of activists of the old Christian right without revising their essential objections to modernity  David Platt  a megachurch pastor who recently took over the leadership of the Southern Baptist International Mission Board  has a crew cut and the conscientious manner of an Eagle Scout  But he has warned evangelicals that too many of them follow “a nice  middle class  American Jesus ”In books titled “Radical” and “Counter Culture ” Dr  Platt urges evangelicals to reject Christian nationalism  “cap” their materialistic lifestyles and give more to charity  He also offers an “unapologetic yet winsome call” to resist the temptation to forsake grueling crusades  like the fight against abortion  for less controversial causes  like opposing human trafficking  “We’ve chosen to be passionate about issues that have been the least costly to us ” he told me  “Countering culture” means recognizing the ways American Christians have mistaken both material and social comfort for spiritual rewards Who are the heroes of these countercultural warriors? They have assembled a selective genealogy that omits evangelicals who once used the language of martyrdom and resistance to defend white supremacy  They trace their heritage from Paul and the Apostles  contemporary America reminds Dr  Platt of the fleshpots of first century Corinth  “a city filled with sexual immorality”  to the Christian reformers of the 18th and 19th centuries  especially William Wilberforce  the evangelical politician who helped end slavery in the British Empire “Wilberforce abolished slavery over many years by working with Christians in different industries ” said Gabe Lyons  who runs a conference and media organization called Q  a Christian version of TED  the Q stands for “Question”   “We want to be a counterculture for the common good ” he said  “A counterculture can be antagonistic  lobbing grenades  but that’s not how Christians should be engaging ”When these evangelical leaders scan recent history for role models  they choose Dietrich Bonhoeffer  the German theologian who died in 1945 at the hands of the Nazis  “A lot of good Germans looked the other way ” said Eric Metaxas  a Christian author who has written popular biographies of both Wilberforce and Bonhoeffer  German Christians “didn’t see that sirens need to go off when the state — any state — starts crossing a line  interfering with the freedom of churches ”Scholars might raise an eyebrow at comparing the Obama administration’s contraception mandate to the policies of Nazi Germany  but Mr  Metaxas stands by the analogy  Evangelicals “have God given freedoms to do so much ” he told me  “But the window is closing  Right now we have tremendous freedoms  and we need to use them  to be a loud  humble  bold  gracious  winsome voice ”Conservative evangelicals cherish the word “winsome ” They use it frequently in sermons  books and blogs   One translation of Colossians 4 6 reads  “Your speech should always be winsome  seasoned with salt ”  It is the key to their political strategy  a signal that they are not the barefoot bumpkins whom H  L  Mencken mocked  nor foaming white supremacists  but a new generation of educated  genteel activists — who still retain their saltiness “Winsomeness” is an aesthetic and an ethos  a cheerful and worldly self presentation meant to disarm secular opponents  Mr  Metaxas sports tortoiseshell glasses  well cut suits and a Yale degree  Mr  Lyons’s organization  with podcasts and conferences packed with talks on subjects like “Redemptive Entrepreneurism” and “Going Glocal ” is the epitome of this combination of glossy sophistication and orthodoxy Yet many evangelical voters don’t seem to want a gracious  cultured leader or a future of subtle minority influence  “Winsome” is certainly not the first word that Mr  Trump brings to mind Mr  Trump’s claim that illegal Mexican immigrants are “rapists ” and his insistence that “we have to be less politically correct ” have vexed evangelical leaders  many of whom favor the liberalization of immigration policy  His tirades remind some observers not of Wilberforce’s “silvery cadence ” but of the fulminations of George Wallace  the hot tempered segregationist Mr  Trump sees himself as a prophet  too  but he is not interested in minority status  “The silent majority is back  and we’re going to take our country back ” he told a crowd in Phoenix in July  Jeremiah Johnson  a minister in Florida  wrote in the Christian magazine Charisma that God told him that “Trump shall become My trumpet to the American people ” Mr  Trump  he added  “does not fear man nor will he allow deception and lies to go unnoticed ”After all  a prophet can’t be courteous and good humored all the time  “Being winsome has its limits ” Rob Schwarzwalder of the Family Research Council wrote during the debate over Indiana’s bill on religious freedom last spring  Mr  Trump’s popularity among the evangelical rank and file suggests that even if his Christian critics can offer appealing models for a new “moral minority ” they may have hit a political dead end  On the campaign trail  anger and xenophobia play better than repentance and grace ","headline":{"main":"Donald Trump and the Rise of the Moral Minority","content_kicker":"Contributing Op-Ed Writer","kicker":"Op-Ed | Molly Worthen","print_headline":"The Moral Minority on the Rise"},"wordCount":"1227"},
